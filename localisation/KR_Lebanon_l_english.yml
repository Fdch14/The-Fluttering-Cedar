 Portrait_Ali_Munif_Bey_Name:0 "Ali Munif Yenenah"
 POLITICS_ALI_MUNIF_BEY_DESC:0 "Some things never change with time – a fitting description for Ali Munif Bey. Born in Adana, Ali Munif Yenenah graduated from Ankara University's School of Political Science in 1896 and held various posts across the empire. His career was abruptly interrupted when he arrived in Mount Lebanon province just as the Great War erupted. The war brought famine and plague that claimed half the Lebanese population, while the surviving half raised their fists in despair, vowing to overthrow Constantinople's rule. Thus, the Ottoman government established the Beirut 'Autonomous' Vilayet to quell unrest, and Ali Munif became its Vali – a position he has held for twenty years.\n\nIf Jerusalem is the Shanghai of the Middle East, Beirut is its Hong Kong: prosperous yet decadent. Beyond the city's glitter – where tourists, bankers, speculators, and gamblers never venture – rebels still roam the villages and mountains, dreaming of expelling the Turks from the Land of Cedars. This dream now seems distant, but the winds of fate are unpredictable. One truth remains clear：if the Beirut Vilayet falls, Ali Munif Bey will be the first to perish with it..."

 LEB.1.t:0 "The Current State of Beirut Vilayet"
 LEB.1.d:0 "During the war, Lebanon suffered severe famine, leading to the death or exile of over half its population. Shortly after the war, large-scale armed riots erupted. Once the riots subsided, the Ottoman government established the nominally autonomous Beirut Vilayet, appointing Ali Munif Bey, an official from the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, as its governor. Twenty years later, four rebel groups—the Phalange, Amal, Communist Party, and SSNP—operated across the Vilayet. Regardless of their beliefs or demands, their singular goal was to overthrow Ottoman rule over Lebanon. Meanwhile, two other forces lurked in the shadows, ready to seize power when the time came. A silent storm was gathering, and no one knew who would claim Beirut..."
 LEB.1.a:0 "Set Sail."
 LEB.2.t:0 "Black Monday Sweeps Lebanon!"
 LEB.2.d:0 "Black Monday struck globally, and Lebanon—a bridge between East and West—suffered severely. Tourism and finance collapsed overnight, streets flooded with unemployed protesters, factories shut down, and rural rebel activity surged. We must act."
 LEB.2.a:0 "To hell with it!"
 LEB.3.t:0 "Religious Unrest"
 LEB.3.d:0 "The economic crisis deepened sectarian divides. Beirut split into Christian and Muslim districts. Reports emerged of Muslim thugs beating Christians to death, followed by Christians retaliating by throwing pig blood at mosques. Rumors swirled that Amal and the Phalange were preparing uprisings, escalating street violence. Fights broke out daily, with over sixty killed."
 LEB.3.a:0 "Misfortunes never come singly."

Fortunately, they avoided the countryside—or they might not have returned. Investment flooded into the Vilayet; our goal was achieved."
 LEB.4.a:0 "Brilliant!"
 LEB.5.t:0 "Taha Hussein’s Visit to Lebanon"
 LEB.5.d:0 "Though blind, Taha Hussein felt ‘freedom and prosperity’ upon arriving in Lebanon. He toured ancient ruins, marveling at millennia-old bricks. As a modernist, he praised Beirut’s forward-thinking governance and Phoenician cultural revival: ‘Civilization should not be bound by religion or race.’"
 LEB.5.a:0 "At least he enjoyed himself."
 LEB.6.t:0 "Sayyid Qutb’s Visit to Lebanon"
 LEB.6.d:0 "Sayyid Qutb, an obscure Egyptian writer, contrasted sharply with Taha Hussein. He criticized Arab nations for opposing the Ottomans instead of allying against Western decadence. In Beirut’s entertainment districts, he scowled at casinos and cinemas, muttering ‘ignorant corruption.’"

 LEB.8.a:0 "Diplomacy’s true purpose."
 LEB.9.t:0 "Mohamed Naguib’s Visit to Lebanon"

 LEB.117.t:0 "The Battle for Paradise - Part I"
 LEB.117.d:0 "Syria's society and people remain trapped in a world far removed from modernity—a realm where nations still vie for survival and dominance through nationalism, sectarian strife, Islamic conquests, and Crusader wars. Religion dominates every Syrian's emotional core, leaving no room for awakening national consciousness or contemplating progressive social rejuvenation.Guided by this medieval mindset obsessed with heavenly rewards, Syria's Social Nationalist Movement must operate in Lebanon and beyond. The challenges are immense. Chief among them is language itself—the "language of Social Nationalism" remains incomprehensible to many. We must teach this language to all who seek solutions. Educating the elderly is futile; thus, the movement naturally targets youth, who embrace new ideas and the lexicon of Social Nationalist virtues, psychology, economics, and politics.Syria failed its first test in interethnic conflict over life and supremacy. Its spirit shattered because this nation was forged solely by pathological religious-sectarian psychology. We abandoned Social Nationalist doctrine, cloaking sectarianism in nationalist rhetoric, while the "developed world" abandoned such thinking to exploit backward nations.As foreign powers carve out Syrian territories for colonization, sectarian divisions are exploited. "Nationalist" politicians masterfully manipulate these divisions, while colonialists swiftly align with sectarian regimes. France’s Mandate accelerated the creation of Maronite Christian, Druze, and Alawite states, nearly establishing a second Christian state for Assyrians. Colonialism weaponized racial rivalries—Arabs, Circassians, Kurds, Assyrians, and "Phoenicians"—weaving them into sectarian conflicts.Amid sectarian hatred and celestial disputes, Syria faces existential crisis. Religious schools indoctrinate youth with distinctions between "prophets" and "messengers," hierarchical distinctions, and which figure reigns supreme. To enter paradise, followers must swear allegiance solely to their chosen prophet/messenger, fighting only for their cause. Every conflicting doctrine is heresy： Orthodox Christians are infidels to Catholics, Protestants doubly damned, Alawite truths blasphemous to Sunnis, and vice versa—endless cycles of dogma."
 LEB.117.a:0 "As long as we fight over paradise, we lose the land!"
 LEB.118.t:0 "The Battle for Paradise - Part II"
 LEB.118.d:0 "These issues define Syria’s archaic, reactionary existence. War is merely celestial combat. Medieval psychology—dominant in non-nationalist Syrian society—prioritizes heavenly salvation over all else. The disaster lies in its refusal to transform "heavenly war" into "earthly unity for land reclamation."Social Nationalists once fought foreign oppressors, driving occupiers from our soil. But the battle against reactionary religious-sectarian psychology rages on. Until Social Nationalist principles triumph, Syria’s nationhood remains denied, overshadowed by rejection.Social Nationalists declare: Heavenly disputes belong in heaven—between individuals and God, not groups. As long as God judges on Judgment Day, worldly conflicts over heaven bring no benefit.Without land, there is no progress—only degradation. The lowly weaken the noble; landowners fall to despoilers. Heaven demands progress, not decay. Protect your nation and land, for therein lies paradise and eternity!"

 LEB.144.t:0 "The River of Unity"
 LEB.144.d:0 "LEB.144.d:0 "When the twin crescent moons hung in the sky, Sadr stood at the delta of destiny. To the left bank, white-robed scholars encircled a debating platform built from the Four Schools of jurisprudence. To the right, black-flagged guards chained shut the stone bridge leading to the holy tomb of Karbala. In the river’s center, gray-cloaked elders burned annotated Quranic manuscripts.\n'Lord, deliver the lost from the hellfire of division.' He clutched broken prayer beads as the eleven stars from Prophet Yusuf’s dream shattered on the river’s surface. His grandfather’s Huwaiti curved blade burned at his waist, its dual edges engraved with "La ilaha" and "Illallah."\nFirst Night： He waded into the left bank’s shallows. A Hanafi elder unfurled an exegesis carpet embroidered with stars and crescents： 'The Four Schools are like fingers, destined to form a fist of divine unity.' Across the river, a Maliki scholar roared： 'Heretical innovations must be purified by fire!' Water slipped through Sadr’s fingers as he glimpsed the shared Zamzam well of Shafi’i and Hanbali caravans in Basra’s marketplace.\nDawn of the Second Day： The central whirlpool swallowed his turban. Salafi preachers balanced a bronze scale on drifting ice： 'Only the teachings of the first three generations are worthy of measure.' From the ashes of burned books, fragments of Ibn Taymiyyah’s manuscripts and Sahih al-Bukhari’s hadiths transformed into white herons. Sadr suddenly recalled pilgrims of all schools pressing their foreheads to the same Black Stone in Mecca’s Grand Mosque.\nSeventh Dusk： Chains snapped on the right bank. Green-turbaned warriors fortified Najaf’s shrine with bricks： 'Only Husayn’s bloodline may interpret divine law!' When they offered a curved blade adorned with an Imam’s portrait, the hilt’s inscription—'Hold fast to Allah’s rope'—scorched their palms. The river mirrored Safavid turquoise domes collapsing in war, tiles bearing the Twelve Imams’ names sinking alongside Sunni Kufic calligraphy.\nNight of the Reunited Crescents： Sadr found a broken pillar on the river’s central shoal. Eroded by millennia of water, faint traces of the Charter of Medina remained：'The faithful are allies to one another.' Three torrents swelled—debating carpets tore into colored rags, bronze scales sank, green turbans blanched in whirlpools.\nClimbing the pillar, he recited： 'O believers, fear Allah as He deserves, and do not die except as Muslims.' The flood revealed the Kaaba’s Golden Door： Hanafi scholars in black turbans and Twelver Shi’a in green scarves took turns touching its ring, passing a silver key unbroken for thirty-six generations.\nAs three waves converged, Sadr drew his grandfather’s blade. The slash parted the waters： left-bank scholars caught shrine bricks from the right bank; midstream elders weighed the Four Schools on salvaged scales. The restored pillar bore a covenant： 'Open Karbala’s bridge every first Friday; collate exegetical texts each Ramadan.'\nThe All-Wise knows this is but a fleeting eddy in the eternal river. Yet Sadr finally understood： when tributaries claim to be the whole, the true course flows silently in the verse： 'Do not divide.'""

 LEB.145.t:0 "Thunder over Mount Marwah"
 LEB.145.d:0 "When the hourglass of the first millennium’s midpoint inverted, the heart of Lebanon’s mountains began to beat. Cedar roots penetrated granite, carving ancient covenants into the clouds. Winds from the Bekaa Valley wove threads of light between shattered minarets, carrying angels’ whispers. The Mediterranean lashed silver tongues against Tyre’s bullet-scarred walls, until every stone oozed olive oil’s fragrance.\nBehold! The eastern horizon cracked with mother-of-pearl veins; morning stars fell upon Jounieh’s waves. Tears of veiled women hardened into amber in Tripoli’s markets; kite strings in children’s hands tautened like lute cords. Elders from seventy sects awoke startled—rosary beads spilled from their palms, rolling across Beirut’s bullet-pocked asphalt to form a crescent moon in Martyrs’ Square.\nSuddenly, mountains knelt and cedars bowed. Lightning burst from the folds of the Chouf range, yet no thunder followed—it was but the flutter of Jibril’s wings. Twelve golden beams rose from Samra’s peak, piercing the iron curtain between Shi’a and Sunni. The war-stained sky split into indigo wounds, raining myrrh-scented drizzle.\nHe descended on stairways of light, his turban’s shadow stretching from Byblos to Zahle. The sacred seal on his brow outshone Phoenician purple; dewdrops of millennia-old wisdom clung to his beard. In his right hand, a broken sword hilt—its blade now plowshares forged from Beirut’s shell casings; in his left, a half-unfurled scroll where emerald sprouts emerged from blank margins.\n‘Peace!’ The greeting shook Sidon’s seawalls, turning bitter brine sweet as Zamzam. Crosses in Christian hands and Quran cases on Muslim chests grew hot; Druze scriptures flipped open to page thirty. Hostages heard chains shatter in damp cellars; springwater gushed from bankers’ vaults, washing away blood-red zeros from ledgers.\nAt Baalbek’s ruins, he paused. Date palm branches from the Prophet’s era sprouted through cracks in Roman columns. Statues of Greek gods shed cold marble, revealing the warm faces of Adam’s children. As his fingers brushed a shattered sun god relief, Damascus roses burst from stone, petals inscribed: ‘La ilaha illa Allah.’\nAt noon, his shadow fell on Tripoli’s conflict-zone barricades. Concrete walls dropped like veils, exposing grafted pomegranate and fig trees. A Sunni elder and Alawite youth plucked fruit from the same branch, their juices merging into honey. Armory gates dissolved into doves carrying olive twigs to forgotten borders.\nAt dusk, he reached Beirut’s trash mountain. A white dome rose from the rot’s vortex; stray cats’ pupils mirrored the Kaaba. Ragpickers’ carts turned gilded palanquins laden with fragments of the Torah, Gospel, and Zabur. Addicts shed black veils from trembling fingers, revealing the luminous faces of Ibrahim’s descendants. ‘You trade Allah’s signs for petty gain,’ his voice shook central bank vaults,\nyet forget every infant’s cry is a hymn to divine unity. Moonlight pierced clouds, illuminating hidden seals on every forehead—those who cursed beneath sectarian banners now glowed with Adam’s primordial light.\nAs the morning star rekindled, he faded. Cedar needles fell, spelling a final revelation: ‘I am resurrected in every heart that inclines to good.’ Bekaa’s vines ensnared falling rockets; the Mediterranean stilled its waves, settling bloody salt into eternal pearls."
 LEB.145.a:0 "Sew the torn veil with olive branches from the same root—beneath unhealed wounds lies resurrection’s seed."
