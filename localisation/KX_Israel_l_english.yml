ISRC.1.t: "Jewish Revolt"
ISRC.1.d: "Extreme Zionist elements, led by Lehi, took advantage of the chaotic period in parliament to rise up against our regime. Haifa has fallen into the hands of these extreme Zionists. They call themselves the Israeli Freedom Fighters, declaring that all means must be used to achieve national independence. Many of our Turkish villages in Haifa have been attacked to varying degrees. The shadow of the British League Covenant faction may lie behind this Jewish uprising, as strange cargo ships docked at the Jewish-controlled port of Haifa.\n\nRegardless, these rioters must be eliminated immediately. We cannot allow the greed of these Jews to destroy Jerusalem Mufti Salaf territory. It will be too late if the Sublime Porte intervenes. Jerusalem's freedom must not be strangled!"
ISRC.1.a: "Kill all these Jewish swine!"
ISRC.1.b: "With the tears of mourning mothers, in the blood of innocent infants..."
ISRC.2.t: "Revolution Victory"
ISRC.2.d: "Through our efforts, the Turks have been utterly crushed. The Jerusalem government has been driven to the Sinai Peninsula and submitted a surrender request to us. To avoid reprisals from the Ottoman behemoth, we have agreed to their surrender. No one can stop the rise of the Jews now. A people wandering for thousands of years have finally returned to Jerusalem, their homeland. As for the Palestinians? They are insignificant. Only two endings await them: die or get out of Jerusalem. This land needs only one people - the Jews."
ISRC.2.a: "Long live!"
ISRC.4.t: "Palestinian Uprising"
ISRC.4.d: "The Arabs of Palestine have not calmed down because the war stopped. Palestinians unwilling to leave Jerusalem gathered in the Haifa district, forming the so-called Palestinian Liberation Army, declared opposition to our regime. They looted weapons stored near Haifa port, and support from Egypt continuously flowed to these Palestinians. Jewish civilians fled the Haifa district to avoid harassment by angry Palestinians.\n\nThese Palestinians have assembled armies on the front lines. War between us is unavoidable. Our warriors will completely extinguish the flame of hope for Palestinian independence. Jerusalem belongs only to the Jews. Let them understand who the true owners of this land are!"
ISRC.4.a: "Destroy them!"
ISRC.4.b: "Free Palestine!"
ISRC.5.t: "Israel Guide"
ISRC.5.d: "First play as Jerusalem. Afterwards, there will be a plot to assassinate Kemal. Soon after the no-confidence vote in parliament, Jewish riots will break out. Choosing to let them be allows you to play as Israel. Then, win against Jerusalem to enter the political line."
ISRC.5.a: "Cool"
ISRC.6.t: "Jewish Riots"
ISRC.6.d: "Some extreme Jews took advantage of the chaotic period in parliament to incite Jewish riots in Haifa city. The riots gradually expanded to the entire Haifa region. Local police stations lost contact with us. Residents fleeing from Haifa to Jerusalem described Jews hunting down government officials throughout Haifa city."
ISRC.6.a: "Suppress the riots"
ISRC.6.b: "Parliament is a mess right now; we have no time for them!"
Israel.1.t: "Insurrection"
Israel.1.d: "Abraham Stern's promise to "immediately open democratic elections once everything stabilizes" was unsurprisingly broken. Having tasted power, Stern was no longer willing to hand it over to the so-called democrats, as they had contributed nothing to the uprising. Lehi's fighters were the first on the battlefield, the first to sacrifice, and the last to leave. For the sake of the fallen and for Abraham Stern himself, the Israeli Freedom Fighters would not relinquish leadership so easily.\n\nThe democrats, however, were not unprepared. They organized the so-called "Democratic Guard" and marched towards Jerusalem. A civil war erupted in the Holy Land. Israeli corpses piled haphazardly on Jerusalem's streets, blood soaking the earth, stench and decay rising to the heavens. Lehi fighters, using advantageous terrain, repelled wave after wave of democrats, but they seemed endless, and a breach was torn in the line.\n\nAfter several days of brutal and bloody civil war, the victor was revealed."
Israel.1.a: "Abraham Stern stands atop the corpses of the democrats"
Israel.1.b: "The Democratic Alliance breaches Jerusalem; Abraham Stern flees in panic"
Israel.2.t: "Order Prevails in Deir Yassin"
Israel.2.d: "Following Leader Avi Ahimeir's policy of "an eye for an eye, blood for blood," premeditated attacks on Palestinian villages unfolded one after another. Fanatical Zionists surged in all directions across Israel, cleansing Palestinian settlements. Villages in regions controlled by the Communist Party of Israel and moderate Lehi were spared. A few fanatics entering these areas were shot dead by local militias. Most other villages were thoroughly looted, and some were massacred to the last person.\n\nAmong the afflicted villages, Deir Yassin suffered the most. Previously, Deir Yassin had experienced several attacks but emerged unscathed after handing over money. The villagers thought giving money again would avert disaster. They overestimated the Zionists' limits. Asleep, the villagers were unaware of the attack until waking to find their village ablaze, bodies strewn on the dirt roads, silenced by bullets before they could scream.\n\nThe looting and massacre lasted all night, until the Zionists confirmed the village was empty. Not one intact house remained, mirroring the villagers' fate. The once-thriving village was reduced to ruins, the smell of charred flesh permeating the land. Deir Yassin is but one instance of this pattern. The Zionists' actions will never cease until Palestinians vanish from Israel's land."
Israel.2.a: "Though brutal, it's exceptionally efficient!"
Israel.3.t: "Soldiers' Mutiny"
Israel.3.d: "The Haganah and Irgun are not our brothers. On the contrary, they are self-serving fools! They launched a rebellion regardless of Israel's future. Our nascent homeland, having barely caught its breath, endured two calamities. This is a betrayal of the Israeli nation-state! Lehi warriors must not allow the country to be destroyed by these traitors. Leader Abraham Stern will personally command the decisive battle against them.\n\nThe final battle commenced this afternoon. Lehi fighters built strong defenses using Jerusalem's walls. It was beneath these ancient walls that Lehi defeated the arrogant democrats. But Irgun and Haganah soldiers are not comparable to the "Democratic Alliance." Like Lehi, they were forged in war. It's a shame that soldiers who should be brothers now clash.\n\nThe battle lasted several hours, and the ultimate victor has been decided."
Israel.3.a: "Haganah and Irgun defeat Lehi's army, establish a provisional military government"
Israel.3.b: "Lehi utterly crushes the coup attempt"
Israel.4.t: "Turning Guns"
Israel.4.d: "The Democratic Alliance was not unified. After ending Lehi's brutal rule, socialists were displeased with the democrats' power distribution, which entirely excluded socialists. Requests for negotiation were flatly refused. Socialists contributed significantly to the coup but faced deception and betrayal; democrats' promised half the seats turned out to be an empty promise.\n\nUpon learning they'd been deceived, socialists immediately rallied their soldiers. Though they had just fought and rest was needed, angry socialists marched regardless. The large force turned its guns and fired upon the "Democratic Alliance" positions. Although democrats knew of the socialist betrayal in advance, their troops hadn't fortified before being caught off guard.\n\nThe "Democratic Alliance" fought back upon regrouping. The socialist attempt to crush the democrats in one blow failed. Another cruel war of attrition unfolded in Jerusalem's outskirts."
Israel.4.a: "The Socialists crush the Democrats at once"
Israel.4.b: "The "Democratic Alliance" cleanses the Socialist opposition"
Israel.5.t: "Socialists Triumph"
Israel.5.d: "The "Democratic Alliance" was utterly crushed by the Socialists. Remnants scattered and pose no threat. Socialist forces now occupy Jerusalem. New elections will be held, but democrats have no part – they paid the price for their deceit.\n\nThe Israeli Communist Party has the best chance of victory. It absorbed many former Palestinian Communist Party members. They wish to establish a proletarian state based on communism and urge Jews to discard prejudice and arrogance against Palestinians. The proletariat knows no nation; only through unity can nations walk the true path to socialism.\n\nNext is Mapai (Workers' Party of the Land of Israel). Its predecessor was the Third International's Jerusalem branch. Most members are various syndicalists and Labor Zionists. They seek to establish a workers' state in Palestine, gradually improve Palestinian rights through law, and eliminate Jewish discrimination and prejudice against Palestinians in education.\n\nThird is the United Labour Party (Mapam). Though once supporters of the "Democratic Alliance," they were the first to negotiate with democrats upon hearing of the socialist exclusion. Failing persuasion, they joined the socialist camp. While some radical socialists criticized their democratic platform, their contribution to the cause remains undeniable.\n\nLastly, the Israeli Kuomintang. They are distinct in leaders and ideology. Their leader, known as "Two-Gun Cohen," claims participation in China's National Revolution. After its failure, he settled in France, founding the party with supporters. Learning of Israel's establishment, he returned with volunteers for the war of independence, hoping to steer Israel towards the Three Principles of the People, which he believes are the true future.\n\nAfter voting, the election results are:"
Israel.5.a: "Communist Party of Israel!"
Israel.5.b: "Mapai (Workers' Party)!"
Israel.5.c: "United Labour Party (Mapam)!"
Israel.5.e: "Israeli Kuomintang!"
Israel.6.t: "Communist Internal Election"
Israel.6.d: "After winning the election, we need an experienced, capable party member to lead the country. The Central Committee nominated four candidates: First is Shmuel Mikunis, a loyal Communist engaged in revolutionary struggle in Jerusalem before the war of independence. Second is Jacob Berman, advocating large-scale collectivization and centralization. He conducted revolutionary activities in Poland before coming to Israel during the war. Third is Moshe Sneh, a former Haganah member who joined the Communist Party before the war, advocating a broadly united socialist government. Fourth is Leopold Trepper, formerly of the Polish Communist Party, joined the former Palestinian Communist Party in Jerusalem, now one of our members. He favors the theories of the Russian revolutionary Bukharin."
Israel.6.a: "Shmuel Mikunis, this loyal and efficient party member deserves promotion"
Israel.6.b: "Our country urgently needs stability; Comrade Jacob Berman is a good choice"
Israel.6.c: "Moshe Sneh, the socialists' split must end; we need unity"
Israel.6.e: "Leopold Trepper, prosperity and socialism are inseparable"
Israel.6.f: "Tony Cliff, Israel will be the vanguard stronghold of the revolution"
Israel.6.g: "Arthur Koestler, Burnhamism will bloom anew in the Middle East"
Israel.7.t: "Professor Magnes Returns"
Israel.7.d: "The renowned scholar and professor, Judah Leon Magnes, recently announced his return from San Francisco, USA. He is a prominent pacifist. Witnessing the horrors of WWI, he became convinced that the dispute between Jews and Palestinians must be resolved peacefully, tirelessly working towards it. He enjoys high prestige among moderate Jewish communities overseas. Thanks to his funding and efforts, many Palestinian villages in the Levant received protection.\n\nLehi's atrocities hastened his return. He arrived in the Haifa region today. His first act was to reach a cooperation agreement with the United Labour Party (Mapam). He joined as a member and will work in education within Mapam-controlled territories on condition that Mapam guarantees protection for Palestinian villages against extremist Zionist encroachment.\n\nClearly, this professor is one of the staunchest opponents of our Israeli Freedom Fighter regime. He began sheltering Palestinians immediately upon returning. Though highly respected among Jews, he could become a hidden source of instability. If necessary, we may eliminate him. Israel belongs to Israelis."
Israel.7.a: "He better pray we don't catch him..."
Israel.8.t: "Ahimeir Demands More Power"
Israel.8.d: "Abba Ahimeir, having gained authority over Palestinian affairs, isn't content. He made demands to Abraham Stern: He wants full administrative control over Israel and expanded security forces to "better" execute Stern's orders.\n\nOur leadership opposes this overreach, primarily because his contribution to the Israeli War of Independence was minimal. Moreover, his forces are notoriously insubordinate, obeying only him, and are too extreme regarding Palestinians, causing much dissatisfaction. While his cruelty and ambition might suit governance, they pose a significant risk to our regime."
Israel.8.a: "Eagerness to work is good!"
Israel.8.b: "What does he think he is?"
Israel.9.t: "Lehi's Total Victory"
Israel.9.d: "Abraham Stern never imagined he would rebuild Israel one day. Years ago, he was an obscure figure within Irgun. Everything changed with his uprising during Jerusalem's chaos. With weapons privately funded by Britain's Mosley and training assistance from the Blackshirts, Lehi drove Turks and Arabs into retreat, leaving only the Sinai government lingering.\n\nOf course, he has opponents: democrats, Haganah, Irgun all betrayed him. Traitors deserve death. Thus, he naturally became Israel's supreme leader. He feels he has done enough for Israel and wishes to step down at an appropriate time, perhaps now. Lehi member Nathan Yellin-Mor shows potential as successor. But Israel hopes Stern remains, as he alone restored a homeland for a people wandering for over two thousand years."
Israel.9.a: "Abraham Stern will remain in office"
Israel.9.b: "Nathan Yellin-Mor takes over as leader"
Israel.9.c: "Ahimeir launches a coup!"
Israel.10.t: "Death of a Sage?"
Israel.10.d: "Lehi's rise is a huge threat to all other forces in Palestine. After Stern seized power, Ben-Gurion chose to ally with the Palestinian Communist Party against Lehi.\n\nIt was futile. Internationally, Lehi's "Sorelian" or "British Covenant Faction" face found appreciation among Third International extremists, who refused to intervene. Domestically, disillusioned Jewish workers, seeing other Zionisms fail, embraced victorious Stern as their "Messiah," flocking to Lehi. Mapai lost its popular base. The Mapai-Palestine Communist alliance retreated across Israel/Palestine.\n\nOne night, Israeli planes bombed a suspected Palestine Communist stronghold. The next day, Lehi soldiers arrived to clear bodies and rubble.\n\nThis was not a communist stronghold, but a Jewish anti-Lehi guerrilla base. Palestinian and Israeli attire are distinct. The Lehi officer recognized one body as Mapai leader Ben-Gurion, but couldn't be certain; he last saw Ben-Gurion half a year prior as an unemployed worker during the Crisis.\n\nThe officer reported to Stern. Stern was delighted and announced the news nationwide. The body, possibly Ben-Gurion's, lay discarded in the wild. With Mapai's influence nullified, announcing Ben-Gurion's death was the final nail in the coffin. Though Ben-Gurion might live, all Jews under Lehi rule accepted his death as fact."
Israel.10.a: "Herzl would never have dreamt of this day."
Israel.11.t: "Silenced Palestine"
Israel.11.d: "Palestine Freedom Radio, an Arab nationalist media funded by Egypt, was an eyesore to Ottoman authorities since Mutasarif era, who tried to destroy it. Now, the Israeli government confirms Palestine Freedom Radio's direct ties to the Grand Mufti or Palestine Arab Party. Back then, lacking evidence and facing Arab obstruction, Ottomans couldn't eliminate it. Now, under Lehi rule, Palestine Freedom Radio shifted from Arab nationalist propaganda to exposing Israeli atrocities worldwide.\n\nStern cares little for international opinion, but pressure from the Third International makes him uneasy. The priority is preventing the Comintern from learning what's happening in Israel. Rather than end persecuting Arabs, Stern preferred silencing Palestine Freedom Radio.\n\nEight days after assigning this task to Ahimeir, Palestine Freedom Radio went silent. No one knows what Ahimeir did. His last broadcast message to the Arab world via their own channel announced:"
Israel.11.a: "I will kill your infants."
Israel.12.t: "Mapai Internal Election"
Israel.12.d: "After winning the election, we need an experienced, capable party member to lead. Mapai central committee nominated three candidates: First is Meir Yaari, a staunch syndicalist born in Galicia, Austria-Hungary. He is a firm supporter of French Commune syndicalism, though denouncing their anarchist tendencies. He prioritized Jewish-Arab coexistence during his time in Palestine.\n\nSecond is Ya'akov Hazan, a revolutionary Zionist born in 1899 in Brest-Litovsk, Russian Empire. He immigrated to Palestine in 1923. He is also a French Commune supporter, viewing it as the Jews' second homeland, praising its syndicalist achievements, and supporting syndicalism's global development.\n\nThird is the right-wing socialist, Zionist Yitzhak Tabenkin. He settled in Palestine in 1912. He is the staunchest opponent of Revisionist Zionism, advocating violent confrontation with them and opposing the German Empire-led imperialist predators. He played a major role in the workers' movement and is a Mapai veteran."
Israel.12.a: "Jewish workers need unity; Meir Yaari is best for this position"
Israel.12.b: "Ya'akov Hazan, promoting comprehensive syndicalism development in Israel"
Israel.12.c: "Yitzhak Tabenkin, this party elder will handle domestic issues"
Israel.13.t: "United Labour Party (Mapam) Internal Election"
Israel.13.d: "Winning the election is just the first step. We need the most suitable candidate to steer Israel's future. Mapam presents four candidates: First is veteran Joseph Sprinzak, born in Moscow Governorate, Russian Empire, later immigrated to Palestine. An excellent organizer and Austromarxist, he advocates reforming Israel's backwardness, eliminating poverty, and widespread social security.\n\nSecond is Levi Eshkol, born near Kiev, Russian Empire, immigrated to Palestine in 1914. He was the most influential Worker's Party-Mapam politician after David Ben-Gurion died in Lehi's attack. He advocates moderate treatment of Arabs, prioritizing civil construction over military, and is an excellent anti-imperialist.\n\nThird is Golda Meir, a tough female politician known as the 'Iron Lady,' praised as braver and more decisive than men. Born in Ukraine, Russian Empire, on May 3, 1898, she arrived in Palestine in 1921, focusing ever since on Jewish liberation.\n\nFourth is the renowned pacifist and anti-imperialist movement leader Judah Leon Magnes, a figure Israel Freedom Fighter claws long to eliminate but failed. He tirelessly worked for a Jewish-Palestinian binational state, sheltering many Palestinians."
Israel.13.a: "Joseph Sprinzak, full speed towards a prosperous society"
Israel.13.b: "Levi Eshkol, the people's interests above all"
Israel.13.c: "Golda Meir, this Iron Lady will lead us into the future"
Israel.13.e: "Judah Leon Magnes, long live the binational state!"
Israel.14.t: "The Dead Sleep Beneath the Abyss"
Israel.14.d: "When the smoke clears, people love to talk of glory. They adorn tattered flags with poetry, immortalize bloody cries in monuments, yet never truly listen to the sighs beneath the abyss. Those buried beneath scorched earth, once flowing with hot blood, now only bones and nameless epitaphs, witnessing humanity's most absurd cycle in eternal silence. War's horn always repeats the same lie. It claims to purify the world for some faith, clear obstacles for some truth. So people under different banners raise identical weapons; people of different creeds utter similar curses. They argue who should rule heaven while letting hellfire spread on earth. When young men are sent to war, rulers call it a path to glory. But when blood soaks the soil, the path ends in nothingness.\n\nThe seeds of division are deeply sown in human nature. People divide camps with language, distinguish foes with attire, create barriers with gods. Authorities forge prejudice into chains, package hatred as virtue, forcing mothers to train sons into butchers with tears. In so-called holy wars, blades always turn against kin, while plunderers sit in golden halls, laughing at the ants' struggle.\n\nBones in the abyss won't speak of pain, but the living must heed this silent warning. Scorched fields, shattered windows, tears on wedding rings – all ask: Whose ideal does this fortress of a million corpses guard? When survivors search ruins for kin's limbs, whose heaven opens?\n\nSome say history is written by victors. But true epics should be carved on every conscience. Lives crushed by collective frenzy, lamentations erased by grand narratives remind us: When violence solves disputes, losers are never just one side. Civilization regresses, hearts cloud, like barren earth after storms, struggling to nurture hope. Yet beneath the abyss, faint light glimmers. When mothers place white roses on nameless graves, when former enemies bow together before monuments, when children plant wildflowers in craters, a force beyond hatred awakens. Not from divine revelation, but from simple understanding – we share the same sky, same air, equally mortal before death.\n\nLet the abyss swallow war's ravings. The living must forge new covenants in sunlight: Stop killing for illusory heavens; stop watering ambition with kin's blood. Perhaps when the last soldier lays down arms, the souls sleeping in darkness can finally find peace."
Israel.14.a: "Above the land, there is no heaven or hell, only the world we choose to build together."
Israel.15.t: "Haganah in Action"
Israel.15.d: "War failures forced the Haganah to act. The current government's incompetence nearly plunged Israel into ruin. Arabs gave us a respite, but the next assault comes soon. Failure to change means certain destruction. Exodus will replay; the Temple destroyed; Jews exiled again; promises and efforts crumble into Arab trophies. Soldiers and independence fighters shed blood in vain. We cannot face the dead's families or soldiers yearning for hope. This is beyond simple promises; it concerns the Jewish people's survival.\n\nHaganah units entered Jerusalem. From Galilee to Negev, Tel Aviv to Hebron, Haganah flags fly. Israel's future is provisionally saved. We must prepare for God's ultimate test: the Arabs' next major assault within limited time. Those responsible for failures face judgment. Government positions lie vacant. This is easy to solve. Patriotic political parties remain; at worst, we form a military government with Irgun."
Israel.15.a: "Form a cabinet with Syndicalists; we desperately need Third International aid."
Israel.15.b: "Form a cabinet with Labor Zionists; we trust our old friends."
Israel.15.c: "We will form the cabinet alone, filling posts with capable citizens."
Israel.15.e: "Form a pure military cabinet with Irgun; soldiers are simple, unlike scheming politicians."
Israel.16.t: "Fate of the German Region"
Israel.16.d: "The once-invincible German Empire lies defeated. Israeli forces occupy all German lands from Berlin to Munich, Rhineland to Prussia. This means Jews, once humiliated guests, finally have a powerful homeland. Celebrations in Israel contrast sharply with defeated Germans' despair. Butchers who once oppressed, expelled, and massacred Jews now tremble as we decide their fate: create a Jewish-controlled central puppet government or choose another path."
Israel.16.a: "Establish a puppet government entirely under our control"
Israel.16.b: "There is a better way to handle Germany"
Israel.17.t: "Israeli Kuomintang Internal Election"
Israel.17.d: "No one imagined we, a young minor party, could win. Our members mostly sympathize with China's National Revolution or studied the Three Principles deeply, finding them viable. Many are Jewish emigrants fleeing rising antisemitism in Europe/America. Though all believing in the Three Principles, internal factions formed.\n\nOne faction, led by Maurice Abraham Cohen (the Orientalists), believe the Three Principles are hard to implement in Israel/Middle East—a region of nascent national consciousness yet widespread apathy and religious control. Appeal is insufficient; they prefer Quran's old dogmas and secular rulers—trust Allah over self. Since Prophet Muhammad, none awakened the Middle East. Only Israel and China can shoulder the Three Principles.\n\nThe other faction, led by Hans Müller (the Nativists), argue that precisely because they are used to dogma, Allah, and kings, they need the Three Principles more. If Muhammad awakened them once, why not again? Through subtle shifts in perception, they can live for themselves, their nation, the people—not an abstract God or oppressive kings. Revolution needs pioneers."
Israel.17.a: "Hans Müller wins majority votes"
Israel.17.b: "Maurice Abraham Cohen wins majority votes"
Israel.18.t: "Religious Melee"
Israel.18.d: "Religious disputes are a constant headache. The main groups are Jews, Western Jewish immigrants converted to Catholicism, local Jews converted to Islam, and Orthodox Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe/Russia. Conflicts were rare before Israeli independence; except Muslims, all united against outsiders. But after independence, lacking an external enemy, they obsess over controlling heaven, neglecting work and family for street debates. Occasionally, extremists clash. This was manageable; call police to disperse or rough them up. But this time went too far.\n\nTel Aviv streets flooded with followers. Normal passage blocked. Debates turned violent, escalating into mass brawls. Sectarians abandoned verbal debates for fists. Within a day, streets littered with wounded. Police, fearing involvement, hid in stations. Only nearby army intervention quelled the riot after three days. Over 600 injured, 2 missing."
Israel.18.a: "Stop arguing! What else should a Jewish state believe? All convert to Judaism!"
Israel.18.b: "Can't you people cause less trouble? Next time, straight to the army!"
Israel.18.c: "Enforce secularization. See if you still make trouble without paradise!"
Israel.19.t: "Republic Reborn"
Israel.19.d: "After prolonged war, most warlords are defeated. Decades of division ended in central China. We control most major territories. Though some warlords resist, the Blue Sky White Sun flag flies again over China. The humiliation of the Northern Expedition's failure is washed away. China's millennia-old monarchy finally crumbled. Accepting our invitation, Mr. Song agreed to become Premier of the Republic of China. Martyrs like Chiang Kai-shek and Sun Yat-sen can now rest in peace."
Israel.19.a: "Long live China! Long live the National Revolution!"
Israel.20.t: "Democratic Elections"
Israel.20.d: "The Democratic Alliance of Herut and Liberal parties defeated the socialist militia's coup plot, occupying Jerusalem's administrative center. Remnant foes pose little threat. Democracy, abolished by the Lehi extremist regime, is restored. Though some soldiers are dissatisfied, it cannot change our victory. New government elections commence.\n\nThe Liberal Party (General Zionists), formed by Jewish loyalists of the former Jerusalem government and immigrant jurists from Europe/America, advocates promoting Jewish rights, opening free markets, constitutional reform, and parliamentary reform. They helped draft Israel's provisional constitution before being driven underground by Stern.\n\nHerut, a nationalist party composed of Revisionist Zionists. Its leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky, a founding father of Revisionist Zionism, is revered by Irgun and Lehi members alike. Herut members are mostly Jewish religious figures and nationalists, seeking a democratic Israeli state for the Jewish people."
Israel.20.a: "Liberal Party Victory"
Israel.20.b: "Herut Victory"
Israel.21.t: "Liberal Party Internal Election"
Israel.21.d: "The Israeli Liberal Party divides roughly into two factions. One, led by Pinchas Rosen, is the Alliance of Political Reformers. They wish to adapt Western constitutions/governance to suit Israel, perfect the judicial system, and establish a truly fair Israeli democracy—neither the Entente's democracy nor the Imperial Pact's authoritarianism, but uniquely Israeli.\n\nThe other faction, led by Peretz Bernstein, supports a free-market system. Trade and diplomacy must go hand-in-hand; more friends mean more trade. Hatred between nations pales compared to money. Labor value is equal—an immutable fact beyond national superiority theories. Money improves livelihoods and leads nations to revival and prosperity."
Israel.21.a: "Pinchas Rosen will reform Israeli politics"
Israel.21.b: "Peretz Bernstein, nothing compares to real money"
Israel.22.t: "Herut Internal Election"
Israel.22.d: "Like other democrats, Herut divides roughly into two factions. One, led by Haim-Moshe Shapira, is the Alliance of Moderate Revisionist Zionists. Unlike Jabotinsky's strong nationalism or Irgun/Lehi extremism, they wish to separate paramilitaries from politics, disband them, integrate members into the regular army or military academies. They seek coexistence with Arabs and call for Jews to embrace past virtues, coexisting peacefully under Jewish law, abandoning extremism.\n\nThe other faction, led by Ze'ev Jabotinsky, is the National Democratic Revisionist Zionist Alliance. Jabotinsky, the founding father, is revered by Irgun/Lehi. They advocate a young Israeli state based on Jewish law, emphasize youth power, urge all classes to build the homeland, support paramilitaries as civil defense, and adopt a stance towards Arabs less moderate than the first faction but far from extermination."
Israel.22.a: "Haim-Moshe Shapira, we need a centrist to stabilize the political situation"
Israel.22.b: "Ze'ev Jabotinsky, a prestigious leader can unite Israel"
Israel.23.t: "Military Government Election"
Israel.23.d: "Stern was crushed. The Haganah-Irgun joint force occupies Jerusalem. Lehi's few months of rule brought unexpected disaster to Jews. Counterattacking was hard; Irgun's pre-battle defection enabled Stern's quick overthrow. Though some fear Irgun's ambition, cooperation was necessary. Now, the military government election decides: Haganah or Irgun will rule Israel."
Israel.23.a: "Haganah assumes command"
Israel.23.b: "Irgun wins the election"
Israel.24.t: "Irgun Internal Election"
Israel.24.d: "Irgun divides roughly into three factions. The mainstream, led by Menachem Begin, are extreme nationalist Revisionist Zionists. They seek revenge against Turks, expulsion of Arabs, internal revenge/patriotism education, Jewish supremacy, and passionately pursue Greater Israel from Jerusalem to Mesopotamia, willing to die for it.\n\nThe second faction, led by Yitzhak Shamir, is unorthodox. Shamir was close to Stern and shared some views but prioritized pragmatism over idealism. As Irgun's chief foreign operative, he shrewdly extracted massive aid from both the Third International and Free World.\n\nThe third faction, led by Benzion Netanyahu, is a new group. As a historian, he excels at learning from history. Connected to US Jewish political groups, he used family funds to stir US politics, viewing America as the Jewish backup plan—New Judea. His followers await the call for statehood."
Israel.24.a: "Menachem Begin, the Jewish people above all"
Israel.24.b: "Yitzhak Shamir, pragmatism is a good method"
Israel.24.c: "Benzion Netanyahu, the importance of history is self-evident"
ISR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "How noble you are, Freedom! Built upon mountains of corpses! Seizing the Ottoman split and Jerusalem parliament chaos, Israeli Freedom Fighters and their militia rose in Haifa. Though the Ottomans had better gear and training, nearly 20 years of development made the Jewish forces formidable. Revolutionaries quickly routed the demoralized government forces, driving them to Sinai. But new problems arose: Distrusting Lehi's success, many Jewish groups didn't join the uprising, leading to Lehi's post-war purge. They hastily formed an alliance against Lehi's purge. Jews are divided once more, and luck may have run out..."

ISRAE_Outpost_of_the_Eastern_Revolution_desc:0 "As a socialist nation in the distant Middle East, we bear the responsibility of serving as a revolutionary outpost.

ISRAE_The_end_of_imperialism:0 "The End of Imperialism"
ISRAE_The_end_of_imperialism_desc:0 "With the German Empire faltering on the European continent, the stubborn remnants of the Entente cower overseas, afraid to advance. It is time for us to join this global war, delivering the final blow to imperialists and colonialists."

ISRAE_The_afterglow_of_the_hegemon:0 "The Hegemon's Afterglow"
ISRAE_The_afterglow_of_the_hegemon_desc:0 "Although the Third International, led by the Commune of France, and the Entente's exiled forces grow daily, the German Empire's prowess as the world hegemon remains formidable. We must not risk war with this colossus; rather, we must stand by them for self-preservation. Though they were once a center of European antisemitism, hatred is temporary, while interests endure."
ISRAE_Anti_red_defenders:0 "Anti-Red Defenders"
ISRAE_Anti_red_defenders_desc:0 "As a spearhead of the Reichspakt at the Middle East crossroads, we shoulder the critical responsibility of guarding against the westward advance of Oriental Reds and the awakening of Arab Socialism. In return, the German Empire's aid will flow ceaselessly into Jerusalem, bolstering Israel's domestic economy."
ISRAE_Middle_East_Agents:0 "Middle East Agents"
ISRAE_Middle_East_Agents_desc:0 "We have secured a pact with the German Empire: our oil and gas resources in exchange for Israel's proxy authority in the Middle East. It's a profitable deal. Both sides are satisfied. We gain a legitimate excuse to rule the Middle East without fearing Ottoman counterattacks backed by Germany. The Reich, in turn, fuels its war machine with a steady supply of oil. Compared to the deceitful old Entente, we are pleased to do business with this reliable customer – the German Empire."
ISRAE_Deep_into_the_Caucasus:0 "Deep into the Caucasus"
ISRAE_Deep_into_the_Caucasus_desc:0 "Russia, the German Empire's greatest adversary in the East, has committed all its forces to the Eastern European front, leaving the Caucasus vulnerable. We can strike Russia unexpectedly in the Caucasus, letting these East Slavic Tatars taste our might."
ISRAE_Wonderful_victory:0 "Wonderful Victory"
ISRAE_Wonderful_victory_desc:0 "With the Syndicalists utterly defeated in Europe, the German Empire has achieved a decisive victory in the Second World War. Though the threat of the old Entente lingers, they are negligible. Victory is now within reach. As victors, we have reaped astounding rewards: the German Empire's prizes and reparations from defeated nations have filled our empty coffers. Plans once abandoned due to lack of funds can now be revived."
ISRAE_Johnny_back_homeland:0 "Johnny Back Homeland"
ISRAE_Johnny_back_homeland_desc:0 "We chose to stand alongside the exiles. Though the sincerity of their promises remains uncertain, it's better than the antisemitic German Empire or the Syndicalists. We hold no real hope for these exiles, but this alignment allows us to consolidate our control over the Middle East. If the winds change, exiting this faction will cost us little."
ISRAE_Authorized_naval_bases:0 "Authorized Naval Bases"
ISRAE_Authorized_naval_bases_desc:0 "We permit Entente fleets temporary basing rights in our ports – at a price, of course. Port maintenance and repair costs demand payment, and we shall demand lease fees from them to fund development elsewhere in Israel."
ISRAE_Troops_assist_in_training:0 "Troops Assist in Training"
ISRAE_Troops_assist_in_training_desc:0 "Our army may dominate the Middle East, but it pales on the European battlefield. Fortunately, the Entente offers modern training methods and military advisors from their exiles. Though down, they were once masters; their military doctrines shouldn't lag far behind the Germans."
ISRAE_Funding_from_the_Delhi_government:0 "Funding from the Delhi Government"
ISRAE_Funding_from_the_Delhi_government_desc:0 "To win us over and bind our interests firmly to the Entente, the British Indian government provides vast funds in exchange for our declaration of war against the German Empire. Free money should not be refused. War declarations can be delayed with excuses until the opportune moment to intervene."
ISRAE_Share:0 "A Share of the Spoils"
ISRAE_Share_desc:0 "The Syndicalists and the German Empire are utterly crushed. The exiles of the old Entente have returned to their cherished homelands. The division and reckoning of defeated nations begin. As victors, we deserve a share – after all, we provided them significant assistance."
ISRAE_Israeli_Army:0 "Israeli Army"
ISRAE_Israeli_Army_desc:0 "The Israeli Army, primarily composed of Haganah militia, is Israel's paramount defense force. Though it pales compared to European powerhouses, in the Middle East, our troops are first-rate, easily overrunning Arab armies still reliant on cold weapons, horses, and camels. Yet, we are not content; a strong defense is the dream of every Israeli."
ISRAE_Memories_of_the_Great_War:0 "Memories of the Great War"
ISRAE_Memories_of_the_Great_War_desc:0 "The Great War was humanity's cruelest conflict to date, birthing many new tactics and equipment. Germany's Stormtroopers infiltrated enemy lines in elite teams; tanks became battlefield leviathans – infantry stand no chance against them."
ISRAE_Formation_of_the_National_Guard:0 "Formation of the National Guard"
ISRAE_Formation_of_the_National_Guard_desc:0 "External forces alone cannot secure our borders. We need a domestic National Guard to handle emergencies: Arab riots, terrorist attacks, etc. In a crisis, this Guard can also serve as backup combat forces to plug front-line gaps."
ISRAE_Expansion_of_the_police_force:0 "Expansion of the Police Force"
ISRAE_Expansion_of_the_police_force_desc:0 "We need a force to maintain internal security. Their primary duty is dealing with domestic crime. They also guard our homeland. In wartime, they can police occupied areas."
ISRAE_Artillery_regiment:0 "Artillery Regiment"
ISRAE_Artillery_regiment_desc:0 "Since Napoleon, artillery has ruled the battlefield. Little survives a full barrage; if something does, a second usually finishes it. Though tank units threaten to overshadow artillery, their cost is prohibitive. Artillery guns, by comparison, are almost cheap."
ISRAE_Calling_patriots:0 "Calling Patriots"
ISRAE_Calling_patriots_desc:0 "We must encourage domestic patriots to join the Israeli Army and urge overseas Jews to aid the motherland. The Army is nascent; it lacks everything: rifles, bullets, artillery. Protecting Israel is every citizen's duty."
ISRAE_Resistant_to_sand_and_dust:0 "Resistant to Sand and Dust"
ISRAE_Resistant_to_sand_and_dust_desc:0 "The Middle East is predominantly desert, vast and endless. Though our lands are relatively fertile, desert warfare is inevitable. To prevent unnecessary issues, sand and dust countermeasures for our troops are essential. No one wants a rifle jammed with sand."
ISRAE_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
ISRAE_special_forces_desc:0 "All eyes are on tanks, the perceived mainstream. Yet they overlook Special Forces. We see their potential. Therefore, while we build tank units, we must also establish Special Forces to maintain tactical diversity for unexpected situations."
ISRAE_Israels_place_in_the_world:0 "Israel's Place in the World"
ISRAE_Israels_place_in_the_world_desc:0 "Israel sits at the junction of Africa and Asia. Westward lies the fertile Nile basin, eastward lies the oil-rich Arabian Peninsula. Thus, the world calls us the keystone of the crossroads – a focal point for those seeking alliance, and a nation many wish to destroy. We must defend ourselves."
ISRAE_Street_fighting_training:0 "Street Fighting Training"
ISRAE_Street_fighting_training_desc:0 "The brutality of urban combat needs no explanation. Traps, ambushes, surprise attacks – all dangers lurk in dark alleys. To prevent our troops being defenseless in such fights, they must train rigorously for the wars to come."
ISRAE_Anti_tank_forces:0 "Anti-Tank Forces"
ISRAE_Anti_tank_forces_desc:0 "We are a small nation; we can't afford battles of tank attrition. But we can afford anti-tank guns. One tank is worth over five anti-tank guns. Destroying one tank with one gun significantly reduces our war expenditure. We must control losses."
ISRAE_Motorized_troops:0 "Motorized Troops"
ISRAE_Motorized_troops_desc:0 "The quicker a war ends, the better. Every day sees lives lost and wealth squandered. We desire a rapid force to smash enemy positions and swiftly end campaigns. The Germans' cherished Motorized Troops are exactly what we need."

ISRAE_Levantine_defense_program_desc:0 "Before embarking on distant campaigns, the IDF has a duty to secure all of Israel. To this end, the General Staff and civil officials will mobilize soldiers and workers to strengthen our defenses against potential enemy offensives."
ISRAE_Stick_to_the_strategic_checkpoint:0 "Stick to the Strategic Checkpoint"
ISRAE_Stick_to_the_strategic_checkpoint_desc:0 "We must not drown in the false fantasy, 'War could never reach us here.' Blind hope doesn't chase enemy ships from Haifa's harbor. Therefore, we must return to the experience that secured settlements against Ottomans and Arabs: build fortifications and guard the passes leading into Israel."
ISRAE_Purchase_of_foreign_equipment:0 "Purchase of Foreign Equipment"
ISRAE_Purchase_of_foreign_equipment_desc:0 "Though we have domestic arms factories, cost-effectiveness lags behind foreign weapons. Imported arms are cheap and effective. Why not buy them? We need only produce our own ammunition; others can supply the guns."
ISRAE_Adhere_to_independent_production:0 "Adhere to Independent Production"
ISRAE_Adhere_to_independent_production_desc:0 "Though domestically produced weapons are neither cheap nor superior, they are crucial to national security. Reliable sellers won't always exist. Once dependent on imports, they'll inflate prices. Therefore, we must perfect domestic industry."
ISRAE_Focus_on_civil_defense:0 "Focus on Civil Defense"
ISRAE_Focus_on_civil_defense_desc:0 "Senior officers cannot oversee homeland defense indefinitely; war demands their focus. Thus, the civil government must implement practical measures to soothe public anxiety. Urge industry to expedite defensive construction and integrate militias and loyal veterans into the National Guard."
ISRAE_High_Command_System:0 "High Command System"
ISRAE_High_Command_System_desc:0 "For our small army, strategic organization outweighs tactical flexibility. We must establish a Strategic Planning Department, teaching soldiers obedience to central commands, regardless of situation."

ISRAE_The_watchman_at_the_crossroads_desc:0 "We are the watchman at the Afro-Asian crossroads. Any enemy foolish enough to cross our land must weigh their strength.

ISRAE_Israeli_Air_Force:0 "Israeli Air Force"
ISRAE_Israeli_Air_Force_desc:0 "Israel's forces must modernize, preparing for upcoming conflicts. Hence, large-scale modernization is crucial, including establishing an air force. We should send students to advanced nations in Europe and America to lay the groundwork."
ISRAE_Solicitation_of_civilian_pilots:0 "Solicitation of Civilian Pilots"
ISRAE_Solicitation_of_civilian_pilots_desc:0 "Our air force is nascent; we urgently need civilian pilots. We've recruited an exceptional pilot: Lou Lenart, a Jewish-American aviator who joined Israel after conflict broke out in the US. He will now command the fledgling air force."
ISRAE_Maritime_airports:0 "Maritime Airports"
ISRAE_Maritime_airports_desc:0 "Due to the growing need for maritime search and rescue and anti-shipping patrols, we must establish a seaplane base near Jaffa Harbor, our largest port city. An attack on Jaffa would destroy our maritime lifeline. We must defend Jaffa."
ISRAE_Aviation_militia:0 "Aviation Militia"
ISRAE_Aviation_militia_desc:0 "To respond to surprise attacks and patrol Israel's skies, we will establish an aerial militia. Should enemies strike from the air, they need only hold out until regular forces arrive."
ISRAE_Expansion_of_the_Air_Force_Brigade:0 "Expansion of the Air Force Brigade"
ISRAE_Expansion_of_the_Air_Force_Brigade_desc:0 "Our current air units are too small for warfare; they can only defend the homeland. Deploying them quickly leads to losses. Therefore, we must expand the air force moderately, within our limited production capacity."
ISRAE_Air_Alert_Troops:0 "Air Alert Troops"
ISRAE_Air_Alert_Troops_desc:0 "Warehouses are full of outdated aircraft – unsuitable for war, unsellable. We must repurpose them. Old they may be, but they fly. Assign them to the Aviation Militia; let them support ground troops and observe enemy movements."
ISRAE_Defend_the_airport:0 "Defend the Airport"
ISRAE_Defend_the_airport_desc:0 "Despite the Mediterranean buffer, vigilance cannot lapse. We must defend our airfields. Should enemy planes darken Israel's skies, it would be too late. Hence, establish constantly manned AA positions, commanding all approaches to our bases."
ISRAE_The_last_value_of_the_flying_club:0 "The Flying Club's Last Value"
ISRAE_The_last_value_of_the_flying_club_desc:0 "The Palestine Flying Club, founded by Jerusalem Jews, secretly aided Jewish immigration. Immigrants sailed from Crete to Cyprus, then flew to Jerusalem via a secret airfield. Though most joined the air force after independence, we can use the Club's name to attract aviation enthusiasts and recruit them."
ISRAE_Ramat_David_air_base:0 "Ramat David Air Base"
ISRAE_Ramat_David_air_base_desc:0 "Ramat David Air Base, one of our main air bases, is southeast of Haifa near Kibbutz Ramat David and Megiddo in the Jezreel Valley. Built under Ottoman mandate as the Ottoman Royal Air Force Ramat David."
ISRAE_Raise_the_Air_Forces_salary:0 "Raise the Air Force's Salary"

ISRAE_Tel_Nof_air_base_desc:0 "Tel Nof Air Base, one of our primary air bases, was established on August 23, 1932, during the Ottoman mandate as the RAF's main base in Palestine. Under Jerusalem rule, it was known as Ekron Air Base."
ISRAE_Construction_of_Air_Force_refueling_stations:0 "Construction of Air Force Refueling Stations"
ISRAE_Construction_of_Air_Force_refueling_stations_desc:0 "So-called 'Refueling Stations' are temporary landing fields. Our bases cannot house excessive aircraft in war, risking annihilation. This is where Refueling Stations shine: aircraft land here briefly to refuel before returning to the front. Severely damaged aircraft can be scrapped on-site, their salvageable parts sent back."
ISRAE_Air_raid_drills:0 "Air Raid Drills"
ISRAE_Air_raid_drills_desc:0 "We must not only seek shelter *after* bombs fall. Cultivating public awareness is vital, for ignorance is deadly. Train citizens to flee buildings and dive into shelters upon hearing sirens. Life outweighs property a hundredfold; only the living can create value."

ISRAE_Appointment_of_the_Governor_of_Civil_Defence_desc:0 "With escalating tensions escalating into a fierce war, Jerusalem and all Israel need leaders to ease panic and protect citizens. Therefore, we must select capable officers to serve as Governors of Civil Defence."

ISRAE_Israeli_Navy_desc:0 "We won independence from the powerful Ottoman colossus, bringing Jerusalem and Haifa into our fold. From trade prospects to expanded military reach, the sea offers Israel opportunities and reduces dependence on neighbors. Though work remains, soon the Israeli Navy shall sail the seas!"
ISRAE_Naval_Examination_Office:0 "Naval Examination Office"
ISRAE_Naval_Examination_Office_desc:0 "Israel has patriotic volunteers. We believe they'll step forward when needed for naval service. But first, we must test their suitability to prevent seasickness and collapse shortly after boarding."

ISRAE_Defend_shipping:0 "Defend Shipping"
ISRAE_Defend_shipping_desc:0 "Our Red Sea ports are remote; our navy cannot reach them. To project naval power requires access through the Suez Canal. Yet, these ports handle vast trade, making them prime targets. Deploy nets to prevent submarine infiltration."
ISRAE_Escort_fleet:0 "Escort Fleet"
ISRAE_Escort_fleet_desc:0 "Our southern coast and seas east of our waters lack defenses. Our fleets are engaged elsewhere. Submarines could inflict heavy losses here. We must form a naval unit dedicated to escort duties in this region."
ISRAE_The_role_of_submarine_forces:0 "The Role of Submarine Forces"
ISRAE_The_role_of_submarine_forces_desc:0 "U-boats are devastating weapons in modern war, capable of crippling enemy ships beyond sight. To protect our merchant fleet and waters, we should develop our submarine forces to deter enemy fleets."
ISRAE_Faltering_naval_plans:0 "Faltering Naval Plans"
ISRAE_Faltering_naval_plans_desc:0 "Though hastily assembled, these escort ships and destroyers form a cohesive naval force under Israeli command. Modest in strength, they serve well for coastal defense, buying time against invaders."
ISRAE_Protect_the_coastline:0 "Protect the Coastline"
ISRAE_Protect_the_coastline_desc:0 "Much of our population, industry, and resources lie near the coast. Defending our coastline is paramount. Aggressors must not land. Blockading enemy coasts brings victory nearer. Our ability to blockade and starve enemies should not be underestimated; we will soon control these waters."
ISRAE_Buy_destroyers:0 "Buy Destroyers"
ISRAE_Buy_destroyers_desc:0 "To bolster our defense, we must invest in destroyers for coastal patrols, forming a true 'Green Water Navy.' European nations sell outdated destroyers; buying them is worth the price for our homeland security."
ISRAE_Recruit_captains:0 "Recruit Captains"
ISRAE_Recruit_captains_desc:0 "Though our naval officers are experienced and passionate, accidents could cripple command. Thus, we must recruit experienced ship captains from civilians for brief training as naval officers. As personnel become sufficient, send them to the naval academy for advanced training."
ISRAE_Naval_Academy:0 "Naval Academy"
ISRAE_Naval_Academy_desc:0 "Israel's navy is young; the Naval Ministry lacks experience. While not instantly solvable, establishing a Naval Academy prepares future officers for any maritime challenge. Protecting our homeland depends on both ships and their crews."
ISRAE_Raids:0 "Raids"
ISRAE_Raids_desc:0 "Our submarines can do more than escort and guard coasts. Prepared for action, they can strike lone enemy ships or merchant vessels. Reducing enemy supplies increases our chances. With minimal risk, why not try?"
ISRAE_Expansion_of_the_naval_base:0 "Expansion of the Naval Base"
ISRAE_Expansion_of_the_naval_base_desc:0 "Beyond coastal defenses, we must protect vital naval bases vulnerable to amphibious assault and expand them appropriately. Our fleet won't remain small; expansion is inevitable. Expand now to prevent future troubles."
ISRAE_Recruit_the_Fisherman:0 "Recruit the Fisherman"
ISRAE_Recruit_the_Fisherman_desc:0 "Manpower shortages plague our navy since its founding. We have few trained sailors, yet our fleet expands. Some ships lack crews. We must recruit from untapped fishing communities. Something is better than nothing; these seafarers have experience."
ISRAE_Swim_in_the_Mediterranean:0 "Swim in the Mediterranean"
ISRAE_Swim_in_the_Mediterranean_desc:0 "From having no navy, we possess a formidable fleet capable of challenging the Ottoman Empire. The Israeli Navy has become a dominant force in the Middle East. The Eastern Mediterranean is open; none can stop us. Our sailors can finally hold their heads high."

ISR_Ignoring_calls_for_democracy:0 "Ignoring Calls for Democracy"
ISR_Ignoring_calls_for_democracy_desc:0 "We declare an end to Israel's imposed democratic illusions. Historical destiny thrives not by mimicking foreign systems, but by reconnecting with the spirit forged over millennia. Jewish survival doesn't lie in parliamentary clamor, but in loyalty to our eternal mission – the collective soul that parted the Red Sea and rebuilt the Temple must shed liberal atomization, reclaiming its redemptive purpose. When Zion is no longer dismembered by alien ideas, its unique light will illuminate the night."
ISR_Fight_for_freedom_for_the_Motherland:0 "Fight for Freedom for the Motherland"
ISR_Fight_for_freedom_for_the_Motherland_desc:0 "Freedom isn't charity; it's forged in blood and iron. Exodus fire courses through Jewish veins. Tear the chains woven by colonialists and collaborators; let Sinai's thunder roar anew over Zion's mountains. Only a guillotine severs the oppressor's tongue; only chariots crush borders of humiliation. Freedom is the cry when the blade presses the world's throat."
ISR_Win_over_Israeli_youth:0 "Win Over Israeli Youth"
ISR_Win_over_Israeli_youth_desc:0 "Offer your youth to the altar, not the bar. Moses raised his staff – the sea parted; Samson pushed – Philistines were buried in mountains. History remembers only burning lives. Join Lehi's ranks. Turn the Wailing Wall's shards into javelins; let the desert storm carry your roar. Cowards rot under neon; warriors live eternal under moon and stars."
ISR_Hit_Maki:0 "Hit Maki (Israeli Communist Party)"
ISR_Hit_Maki_desc:0 "Those traitors stirring idealism with coffee spoons carve ancestral skulls into multicultural baubles. The left's dictionary holds no 'Holy Land', only property for sale. Wrap their tongues in Torah parchment; expose their hypocrisy under the Gibeon sun. When olive branches become white flags of surrender, the axe is the only truth."
ISR_Expose_the_stupidity_of_David_Ben_Gurion:0 "Expose Ben-Gurion's Stupidity"
ISR_Expose_the_stupidity_of_David_Ben_Gurion_desc:0 "That clay-footed giant, founded on compromise, has hollowed our national spine. His ghost still shadows the Knesset dome.

ISR_Authorized_Ahimeir:0 "Authorize Ahimeir"
ISR_Authorized_Ahimeir_desc:0 "Ahimeir's grip can crush every enemy grain of desert sand. He's no diplomat; he's the judge bearing the Book of Numbers. Palestinian cries? They're the Amalekites' death rattle. Let him bind their throats with the burial shrouds of Hebron's patriarchs. Drench every contested land in our ancestors' blood and salt – only absolute sovereignty ends the millennium of wandering."
ISR_There_will_be_no_more_Hebron_tragedy:0 "No More Hebron Tragedy"
ISR_There_will_be_no_more_Hebron_tragedy_desc:0 "When Arab daggers pierce our hearts, weeping desecrates our ancestors. Each Hebron blood drop must become molten steel, forging a new Ehud's sword.

ISR_Expand_Lehi_mandate:0 "Expand Lehi Mandate"
ISR_Expand_Lehi_mandate_desc:0 "The Knesset's arguments sicken more than Canaan's frogs. Grant Lehi absolute power; let the State Security Bureau be the new Ark of the Covenant – touch it and die.

ISR_Completely_shatter_parliamentary_illusions:0 "Completely Shatter Parliamentary Illusions"
ISR_Completely_shatter_parliamentary_illusions_desc:0 "Six hundred and fifty-five seats are ruins of a modern Babel. While parliamentarians measure lands in votes, we'll remap borders with tank treads. Dismiss the noisy theatre; let the Pentateuch replace the constitution. Sinai's thunder requires no vote."
ISR_Standing_in_a_sea_of_blood:0 "Standing in a Sea of Blood"
ISR_Standing_in_a_sea_of_blood_desc:0 "Compromise binds freedom in gilded cages. Let David's Star ascend to the vault on gunsmoke, or let the nation vanish in brimstone lakes.

ISR_Closure_of_Radio_Free_Palestine:0 "Closure of Radio Free Palestine"
ISR_Closure_of_Radio_Free_Palestine_desc:0 "Those radio waves are snakes hissing in Eden. Unplug their microphones; tune frequencies to Holocaust sirens. Turn every Palestinian poet's line into a last word, every anthem into a dirge. Sterilize ideology's plague with lead and fire."
ISR_Attacks_on_Arab_settlements:0 "Attacks on Arab Settlements"
ISR_Attacks_on_Arab_settlements_desc:0 "As ancestors slew Philistines with lamb bones at Gilead, we rain missiles on hostile villages. Tenfold revenge? No, a hundred, a thousand! Let the Negev's sandstorms carry napalm; let Gaza's groundwater mix with enemy blood. Arabs speak only the grammar of power; we're writing the verb in past perfect tense – thoroughly completed."
ISR_The_Israelites_shook_off_their_chains:0 "The Israelites Shook Off Their Chains"
ISR_The_Israelites_shook_off_their_chains_desc:0 "Power isn't cake; it's a thousand-times forged blade. Tie dissenters to Masada's ruins; replace wedding photographers with Mossad agents. Revise textbooks, engrave 'resistance' into children's bones; recast shekels, replace olive branches under the eagle's claw with barbed wire. Remember: the merciful ruler was the one crucified."
ISR_Stern_our_Savior:0 "Stern, Our Savior"
ISR_Stern_our_Savior_desc:0 "As Stern's blood seeped into the Judean desert, it forged the Messiah's crown. He's no prophet; he's the martyr walking on the blade's edge. When bullets pierced his ribs, Zion's redemption clock began to count down. Emblazon his portrait on our flag; let every cry of 'Masada shall not fall again!' become new scriptures. The Messiah won't descend by miracles but by madmen plugging history's gaps with flesh."
ISR_Unite_the_Israelites:0 "Unite the Israelites"
ISR_Unite_the_Israelites_desc:0 "Scattered genes bear the inscription: 'Drink the enemy's blood together in the desert, or freeze collectively in Auschwitz's snow.' Division? A Hellenistic plague.

ISR_Red_Terror:0 "Red Terror"
ISR_Red_Terror_desc:0 "Iron fist must be quenched on enemy skulls. Revise the 'Ten Commandments of Martial Law': Question Lehi? Enslave like the Gibeonites. Collude with foreigners? Swallowed like Korah's band. Turn kindergartens into ideological smelters; replace fairy tales with Lamentations. Let Lehi agents officiate wedding vows. Remember: Sinai's Law isn't parchment; it's red-hot iron chains. We forge shackles only to strangle an era's throat."
ISR_British_aid:0 "British Aid"
ISR_British_aid_desc:0 "The steel will tempered in the British Union's twilight is Zion's quenching fire. Mosley's pounds aren't charity; they're horseshoes traded with the Horseman of Revelation. He shaped our death squads with Blackshirt discipline; refracted Zionism's edge through corporatist prisms. History asks only success, not allies' hue. While London salons scoff, we'll fuel bombers with his gold and rebuild Jerusalem's walls with Koran-papered blueprints."
ISR_Political_Commissar:0 "Political Commissar"
ISR_Political_Commissar_desc:0 "Pure ideology must be stamped into the spinal cord with a Talmudic seal. Place Commissars wielding Uzis and the Book of Numbers in every unit. Use Passover's bitter herbs to test loyalty. Any who lisp humanitarian nonsense in battle reports will be lashed to Sodom's Lake of Fire simulators. We want not soldiers, but live shells fused with ideology."
ISR_Raise_the_torch:0 "Raise the Torch" (Building the Third Temple)
ISR_Raise_the_torch_desc:0 "The Third Temple's foundation isn't marble; it's Palestinian rubble. Bulldozer roars replace the shofar; concrete jungles supplant the menorah. When trowels yield to mechanical claws – then we know: the true sanctuary lies not beneath any dome, but in the territory watered by enemy blood."
ISR_Inciting_fanaticism:0 "Death Worship"
ISR_Inciting_fanaticism_desc:0 "The grave is glory's shrine; bones are vow-inscribed stelae. As ancestors were shredded by Roman lions, their blood-foam cursed tyranny. As Masada's children leaped, their fall echoed as thunder in history. Fear death? A heathen's softening! Fit each coffin with a gunsight; turn death notifications into decorations. Zionism's essence is forging life into a javelin against God's enemies."

ISR_Let_the_Turks_pay_for_their_blood_debts_desc:0 "Ottoman scimitars split our fathers' bellies; Kemal's hypocrisy rekindles the Sultan's noose. Istanbul's minarets shall witness our reply: carve Exodus new chapters with missiles on the Bosphorus; machine gun nests weave fire nets for Topkapi Palace. Revenge isn't an option; it's arithmetic – every drop of Jewish blood squeezed by Pashas demands Ankara's magma repaid a hundredfold."
ISR_Approval_of_the_Lehi_Youth_Corps:0 "Approval of the Lehi Youth Corps"
ISR_Approval_of_the_Lehi_Youth_Corps_desc:0 "The Corps' pupils must burn with Sinai sulphur, not nightclub neon. Arm patches at fourteen; manhood rite at Gaza's border at sixteen.

These practices prove that truly giving decision-making power to the laborers does not cripple productivity; instead, it reduces bureaucratic wrangling. What we should learn is not a copy of the system, but their practical 'crossing the river by feeling the stones' spirit – trial and error first on a small scale, scale up what works, start over if it fails. Most critical is adhering to two bottom lines: we cannot let capital regain control of the means of production, nor let those who only talk theory lead reforms astray."

For example, the power grid system can dynamically distribute peak/off-peak electricity according to the industrial characteristics of each town; likewise, medical equipment production can adjust shipments in real-time based on hospital bed numbers. But planning is not rigid tables; a dynamic feedback mechanism must be established: when fishermen report insufficient cold storage causing seafood spoilage, planning departments should promptly adjust infrastructure investment direction; if schools report that textbook printing can't keep up with demand, printing plants must be immediately coordinated to increase output."

When rebel gunfire echoed through Jaffa's streets, when Turkish land decrees attempted to blockade immigration, these pioneers defended crops with rifles and broke sieges with cooperatives. They were not mythical heroes but down-to-earth pragmatists with calloused hands – experimenting with collective labor in kibbutzim while preserving family farming in vineyards.

Bedouin cavalry battled Ottomans to reclaim Mecca; Iraqi insurgents attacked German advisory groups with improvised bombs; these struggles share common interests with our Zionist movement. Cooperation can start with concrete tasks: we train mechanics for them to repair weapons; they provide desert marching expertise to Jewish settlements.

When Ottoman police seized immigrant ships, it was the workers' pickets who broke the blockade in fishing boats; when Arab attackers came, it was socialist youth brigades defending orange groves with shovels. The Zion we pursue is not a religious kingdom but a workers' republic where a milkmaid can study mechanics in night school and a bricklayer's son gets free medical care.

MAPAI_Intensive_industrialization_desc:0 "Engineers at Jaffa port and blacksmiths in Nazareth understand: dispersing factories to over a dozen kibbutzim might be safer, but shuttling machine parts between Nahalal and Beersheba is inefficient. Ottoman blockades and German air threats force us to take risks – concentrating power plants and munitions workshops in Haifa Bay, fortifying roofs with concrete, camouflaging them with citrus groves. Every chimney might collapse in an air raid, but it's better than workers dying of dehydration carrying parts boxes through the desert. Remember, where assembly lines concentrate, anti-aircraft sentries and fire brigades must concentrate equally – it's a gamble trading efficiency for survival, requiring vigilance from every lathe operator and welder."

On the collective farm, Jewish immigrants taught Arab neighbors drip irrigation for tomatoes in exchange for ancient experience identifying sandstorms. In technical school diesel engine classes, students of both ethnicities passed tools to each other, sweat dripping onto the same drive belt. The Hadera market witnessed the simplest consensus: an Arab potter helping a Jewish mother look for her lost child; a Jewish hardware shop owner repairing a nomad's tin water jug for free. Though deep in the desert, cold guns still break the night's peace, more people walk into the same citrus groves at dawn – when cooperation becomes a survival instinct, parts on assembly lines and pencils in classrooms will naturally pile into the foundation of a new homeland."

For example, five villages share an orchard, distributing profits based on labor; abandoned saline-alkali land is collectively transformed into fishponds by returning youth; vacant land on urban edges is allocated to mobile vendors for a fixed market. The focus isn't who owns the land, but ensuring it truly sustains people—rules must prevent profiteering by flipping; farmers must be taught soil-testing and fertilization; cooperatives must connect to logistics and supermarkets. When people understand they're guarding not just land but their livelihoods, they'll naturally unite."

What needs shattering are the invisible chains binding people—helping herders install solar panels against sandstorms, giving street youth auto-repair shops for a living, bringing housewives of different sects together to knead dough in a community bakery. When hospital wards no longer segregate by faith, and fairness in court outweighs religious edicts, liberation truly begins.

Rather than debating whose lineage is purer, cooperate to make the Negev desert bloom—Bedouin herders know best where to find groundwater; Jewish agronomists excel in drip irrigation.

Full granaries depend on whether old farmers can farm in peace; stable policy requires listening to village tea-house bench meetings. Instead of slogans, help Eastern village build reservoirs, send Western village drought-resistant seeds—when Old Zhang's wheat harvests 30% more, he'll naturally tell fellow market-goers about the policy. More crucially, ensure farmers have seats in the council: they must approve cooperative dividends; they must understand tax breaks.

Rather than blaming those idling against walls, send agricultural technicians to the fields—hand-teaching composting techniques, demonstrating locust control. Cooperatives should subsidize sown acres, not dole out relief grain per head. Let the lazy see old Hassan next door: drip irrigation makes grapes ripen half a month early, fetching triple the price before the festival. When the market piles high with onions, the lazy won't sit still. Remember, land rewards sweat, but don't expect others to share their bread when you're starving."

Don't underestimate Jewish youths and Arab matrons working side by side in collective farms—the drip irrigation pipes they share can irrigate more hope than border walls. When the cooperative oil press spins, the kibbutz cafeteria smells of hummus, and Tel Aviv supermarket shelves hold local olive oil. Teaching the desert to yield crops is vital, but so is ensuring pepper farmers have seats in parliament.

Regular meetings, discussions, and votes prevent excessive concentration of power while enabling policy adjustments. Without parliament, either minorities dictate or chaos reigns. Like Nordic countries resolving labor disputes through parliamentary negotiation, or South Africa dismantling apartheid through parliamentary reform, they prove this platform can settle differences at the table. Though parliaments need improvement, dismantling this communication channel blocks society's self-regulation."
HAPO_Israel_agrees:0 "Promote Israeli Identity"
HAPO_Israel_agrees_desc:0 "Many Jews living locally for generations scarcely identify with Israel's 'Jewish state' status. Their ancestors intermarried and coexisted with Arab neighbors; their daily Arabic surpasses Hebrew; Eid al-Adha is livelier than Hanukkah. Fishermen in Jaffa's old city preserve mixed-resident traditions. This natural cultural fusion isn't inherently problematic, but amid heightened national tensions, bonds of identity need rebuilding—not through forceful indoctrination, but by reviving old synagogue alleyways, reopening traditional workshops, organizing cross-generational cultural learning, letting youth touch ancestral wisdom daily. Like Haifa artisans rediscovering olive wood carving, ancestral patterns naturally flow from their chisels."

Workers use unions to secure fair hours, like textile workers who fought for the eight-hour workday; collective bargaining improves conditions, like miners who forced ventilation installations by gauging toxicity. Now, with precarious workers unprotected, unions need innovation—night schools teaching skills, mutual funds for health emergencies, collective bargaining for profit-sharing. This regulator prevents capital's unchecked expansion from crushing labor while avoiding upheaval. Protect this bond for societal stability."

Upgrading rural hospitals with emergency equipment, training village doctors, promoting family physician systems—these are tangible steps. Government investment and societal participation weave a denser health network, best rewarding public trust. It's responsibility and benefit: healthy people drive sustainable development."

Initially sheltering in tents, they greeted each other in Russian, Yiddish, Polish. Healing scarred souls requires more than bread and blankets: provide evening Hebrew classes, guiding their hands to write ancestral script; set collective farms where mentors teach olive tree cultivation, letting mud-stained hands feel the Promised Land's touch; preserve weekly Shabbat meals at community centers where immigrants' borscht meets local hummus. When kibbutz children recite poetry in Slavic-accented Hebrew, roots finally anchor in the soil."

HAPO_Declare_war_on_poverty_desc:0 "The war on poverty isn't sloganeering. It means mountain children can study, not herd sheep; villagers sell produce without trekking miles; elders afford medicine without cost calculations. Our three-step approach: assign aides to destitute families, teaching skills and marketing; improve roads linking remote areas to markets; strengthen healthcare/education nets. Electrify mountain hollows in five years, build highland roads in ten, ensure medical care for all in twenty. Reject hollow metrics; demand hard indicators—meat on every table, savings in every home, college graduates in every generation. It's neither hasty nor procrastinable. Like replacing a house's beams, it takes the whole village. When migrant parents return to open rural tourism and left-behind children enter city schools, poverty ends."
