POLITICS_ABULLAH_WAZIR_DESC: "Abdullah bin Ahmed al-Wazir, former governor of Zamar and Hodeidah under the Rashid Dynasty, witnessed the regime's decay: famine-stricken lands and systemic corruption eroded his loyalty. After secret dealings with the Free Yemen Movement and Ali Nasser al-Qardaei's aid in assassinating Imam Yahya, Wazir leveraged political capital to claim power. Though tribal leaders reluctantly acquiesced, Ottoman support for the Rashids lingers—we must guard against their schemes."

YEM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Following Ottoman Victories in Southern Arabia and victory in the Weltkrieg, along with collapse of the British Empire in 1920, Yemen experienced a large growth in the size of her borders. However with the continued Ottoman governance of the Sunni populations and their extremely lax ruling of the areas under their control the newly enlarged state found itself riddled with unrest. With the Zaydi Shia Imam at the head of state, he seeks to dominate the Yemeni lands, earn his freedom from the Ottomans, and defend what his country had rightfully earned."
