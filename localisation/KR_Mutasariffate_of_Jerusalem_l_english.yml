pal.1.t:0 "Jerusalem Mutessarifate in 1936 - The Arab Heartbeat, Part I"
pal.1.d:0 "The Jerusalem Mutessarifate lies at the junction of the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Egypt, bordering the Suez Canal and controlling the Holy City of Jerusalem, holding immense political and economic significance.\n\nThe Jerusalem Mutessarifate emerged as a compromise. During World War I, the Ottoman Empire, led by the Three Pashas government, performed poorly against Allied forces, while Arab revolts against Ottoman rule further weakened its position. Though the Ottomans regained Arab territories post-war, their poor performance cost them negotiating leverage.\n\nThe Ottomans became the sole defeated power among the Allies. Germany demanded the establishment of international mandates in Palestine and Sinai, managed jointly by Germany, Russia, Canada, the Algerian French regime, Austria, and the United States. The Ottomans' sole concession was retaining nominal sovereignty over Jerusalem, governed by an international committee. This marked the birth of the Jerusalem Mutessarifate."
pal.1.a:0 "Proceed."
pal.111.t:0 "Jerusalem Mutessarifate in 1936 - The Arab Heartbeat, Part II"
pal.111.d:0 "Years after its establishment, foreign garrisons withdrew, leaving only German forces to manage the Suez Canal. Ignoring local welfare, Germany focused solely on profit. Rising nationalism drew Zionist settlers to Jerusalem under the Balfour Declaration, with Allied encouragement to establish a Jewish homeland. However, tensions between Jews and Arabs escalated, prompting the Ottomans to establish the Jerusalem Assembly, weakening international oversight.\n\nThe Ottomans, revitalized under Mustafa Kemal's leadership, sought to reclaim sovereignty over Jerusalem and expand into Egypt. Yet Jerusalem remained a powder keg： Arabs resented Ottoman rule and Jewish immigration; Jews demanded statehood; Ottomans aimed to dominate the city and Egypt."

pal.4.t:0 "Severe Shortages"
pal.4.d:0 "International markets remain chaotic, exacerbating coal, oil, food, and industrial shortages. Manufacturing halts. Port layoffs cripple Jaffa, while Ottoman relief shipments are blocked at borders to prevent economic reliance on Damascus and curb arms smuggling."

pal.6.t:0 "Sinai Smuggling Routes"

PAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Jerusalem International Mandate, or perhaps not so international anymore, has managed to avoid descending into the state of a consular city thanks to the iron-fisted rule of its current Governor. Through the hands of the Jerusalem Governor, the Ottoman Empire regained control over all aspects of Jerusalem shortly after the war. The title of "International Mandate" now hangs by a thread - this ugly byproduct of the last world war will eventually revert to being a Vilayet of the Empire once more."

MOJ_Strengthen_Kemalist_education_desc:0 "The People's Party demands the strengthening of Grand Vizier Kemal Pasha's ideology in Jerusalem, requiring government officials to adhere to the Six Arrows principle to prevent the spread of heretical ideas, thereby stabilizing the mandate."

MOJ_Strengthening_Palestinian_national_identity_desc:0 "The Independence Party proposes establishing an Arabic-language national academy, purging Ottoman Turkish textbooks, incorporating Canaanite epics and the Jerusalem Jihad into mandatory history curricula, hanging the Double-Bladed Crescent flag in mosques, reenacting Saladin's liberation of the city, and distributing nationalist geography manuals to Bedouin tribes, framing Ottoman railways and telegraph lines as cultural shackles."

MOJ_Reconstitution_of_urban_population_desc:0 "The Holy City Integration Act mandates mixed housing by profession and clan, creating the 'Mount of Olives-Zion Gate' axis with shared wells and bakeries. Cross-ethnic patrols and secret surveillance tunnels aim to suppress dissent."

MOJ_Security_gendarmerie_desc:0 "A 'Holy City Gendarmerie Brigade' combining Kurdish cavalry, Arab tribesmen, and Jewish recruits enforces martial law. Prussian-trained officers patrol the Western Wall to Al-Aqsa Mosque, detaining 'agitators' without trial and digitizing interrogation records."

MOJ_De_Ottoman_authority_desc:0 "The Sanctuary Autonomy Act abolishes direct Ottoman rule, replacing it with a multi-ethnic parliament. Crescent symbols are replaced with a 'Citadel-Star' emblem, burning Ottoman legal codes and adopting a hybrid Quran-Torah judicial system."

MOJ_Suez_Exchange_Agreement_desc:0 "A treaty with Germany grants special three-color flags for Ottoman ships in the Suez Canal, while German engineers dredge Jaffa Port. In exchange, 20% of port revenue funds steam cranes from German factories."
