SUE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Post-WWI, Germany secured Suez Canal trusteeship via the Port Said Convention, forming a German-led commission. Initial suppression of Anglo-French-Russian industrial protests over forced share buyouts sparked international backlash. Under pressure, Germany formed an inclusive commission, enacting share reforms and toll cuts. Amid Russian turmoil and Austrian ethnic strife, shareholder sell-offs fueled commission infighting. Governor Rheinbaben’s later share reforms eased disputes, though his conservative ties drew suspicion of coercion. Canal governance stayed contentious amid German dominance and multilateral disputes."
sue.1.t: "1936 - Storm Brews in Suez"
sue.1.d: "Since the end of the Great War, the German Empire naturally gained opportunities to fully take over key economic territories as the primary victor. While consolidating influence in East Asia and swallowing Africa whole, this seasoned victor remained unsatisfied. After signing the 1918 Port Said Convention with the British government-in-exile, the Suez Canal officially became a German mandate, granting authority to establish an administration. The Germans exerted their full shareholder power here, forming the Canal Committee to manage maintenance and development. However, Suez proved difficult to govern - British/French/Russian industrialist groups holding canal shares vehemently opposed the mandate government. Initially, German garrisons suppressed these industrialists while the profit-driven Canal Committee sought complete control through forced buyouts.\n\nUnder diplomatic pressure from exiled governments and Austro-Hungarian industrialists, Germany partially withdrew troops and established the Second Canal Committee dominated by German business associations and progressive parties. Canal policies gradually liberalized with lowered tolls and share redistribution, calming industrialist anger. Subsequent Committee work focused on boardroom disputes and share struggles. As Russia descended into chaos and Austria-Hungary faced ethnic conflicts, mass share sell-offs froze Committee relations. The new Governor Rheinbaben, a conservative liberal close to Stresemann, implemented share reforms using questionable methods to reduce infighting."
sue.1.a: "1936 - Suez remains prosperous, may Suez prosper forever!"
sue.1.b: "Tell me more about Suez"

sue.2.t: "Suez City Trade Union"
sue.2.d: "Founded in 1920 during the First Canal Committee's oppressive policies, this union began as worker representatives within canal companies before expanding citywide. Previously lacking union systems, Suez relied on Anglo-French company welfare policies requiring mandatory membership.\n\nIts establishment initially shocked German authorities until the Second Committee negotiated worker benefits with multinational industrialists. However, Governor Rheinbaben later suppressed union influence, forcing leftists into exile. Despite this, the union retains significant power to challenge canal authorities."
sue.2.a: "What's the internal situation in Suez?"

sue.3.t: "Black Monday Hits Suez"
sue.3.d: "The Black Monday crisis has reached our mandate government. With Germany's economic collapse, all indicators show impacts - we must use German-Suez funds to fill gaps. Mounting cargo, fluctuating tolls, worsening labor policies, and recent development strategies approved by the Committee now crush the administration. Lean times ahead require seeking help from Ottoman or Canadian allies."
sue.3.a: "Damn it!"

sue.4.t: "Factional Struggles"
sue.4.d: "Suez's Egyptian cultural roots span millennia. Modern colonialism saw Ottoman development of the vital canal before Egyptian control post-independence. After WWI, Germany's Port Said Convention reshaped regional order, maintaining ambiguous recognition of Egyptian claims while cultivating nationalist allies.\n\nThe German-controlled Canal Committee holds veto power over board decisions. While the first committee under Otto von Lossow collapsed under diplomatic pressure, the second's liberal reforms bred factionalism - Ottoman railway engineers, Tirpitz's marine detachment, committee liberals, and national garrison blocs now engage in daily power struggles."
sue.4.a: "What about the Canal Committee?"

sue.5.t: "Funds Received"
sue.5.d: "Per German Economic Ministry reports, the full 200 million Reichsmark from the 'German Maritime Trade Canal Fund' has arrived as part of Second Committee agreements. We can now address budget deficits and begin recovery plans synchronized with Germany."
sue.5.a: "Excellent!"

sue.6.t: "British Exile Industrialists Offer Aid"
sue.6.d: "Though Britain lost most shares through the Port Said Convention, Canadian-based British shipping magnates like Lord Macrae and Baron Inverforth propose using the Suez Construction Fund to reopen the canal quickly, countering Black Monday impacts through infrastructure investment."
sue.6.a: "All to survive the crisis"

sue.7.t: "Algerian Labor Aid - French Revanchism Rises"
sue.7.d: "The Algerian-exiled French regime eyes Suez's prosperity. Though Germany took majority shares, France remains second-largest stakeholder. Algerian labor deployments and Charles-Lou family's mediation between industrialists and Pétain's militarists have reignited French revanchism, particularly after recent labor ban lifts."
sue.7.a: "Not bad"

sue.8.t: "Russians and the Suez Canal"
sue.8.d: "Post-WWI chaos allowed Russian industrialists like the Dolgorukovs to buy shares during Committee restructuring. However, political turmoil forced massive sell-offs, leaving Russia as the smallest stakeholder. Stability could bring renewed Russian influence."
sue.8.a: "Ah, those Russians..."

sue.9.t: "Austro-Hungarian Transport Hegemony"
sue.9.d: "As wartime victors, Austria-Hungary gained 55% of British shares through the Convention. Camillo Castiglioni's transport monopoly via Suez's sole airport/vehicle factory maintained influence despite later stock sales. Their industrialists remain crucial players."
sue.9.a: "Fraternal strife"

sue.10.t: "America - Suez's Loser"
sue.10.d: "Isolationist America holds minimal 4% shares managed by its Commerce Department. German plans to acquire these final US holdings would eliminate their token influence in this German-dominated sphere."
sue.10.a: "Let the sleeping giant lie"

sue.11.t: "Ottoman Trauma and Decline"
sue.11.d: "Germany's junior partner gained Suez footholds through the Convention but sold shares during decline. Their remaining 11% stake barely sustains faltering Ottoman economics - a fading cry in international markets."
sue.11.a: "Who cares about them?"

sue.12.t: "Canal Committee - Railway Faction"
sue.12.d: "Led by Meißner Pasha, this pro-Ottoman technocrat faction dominates transportation through Berlin-trained engineers. Their growing Ottoman ties and technical control make them indispensable yet dangerous allies."
sue.12.a: "Understood"

sue.13.t: "Anti-Semitic vs Pro-Jewish Factions"
sue.13.d: "Nationalist currents permeate Suez. Kurt von Schleicher's emergency command infiltrated by Fatherland Party anti-Semites clashes with pro-Zionist elements from Eastern News Office. Balancing these powder kegs proves crucial."
sue.13.a: "Understood"

sue.14.t: "Suez Corruption Scandal"
sue.14.d: "Post-Black Monday normalcy shattered by discovery of forged 40,000RM Kaiser Wilhelm Society checks. Mounting protests force Rheinbaben to announce comprehensive anti-corruption reforms, potentially birthing a Fourth Canal Committee."
sue.14.a: "Damn"

sue.16.t: "Project Embezzlement"
sue.16.d: "German autonomy grants bred corruption - subpar materials, avoided demolitions, and stolen worker funds exposed by French Commune journalists. Berlin's subsequent cover-up and increased 'worker subsidies' only enriched corrupt officials."
sue.16.a: "Thieving bastards!"
sue.17.a: "How much did they steal?!"
sue.17.t: "Trade Discrepancies"
sue.17.d: "Lax oversight enables tariff evasion through bribes. While European nations benefit, Germany alone bears losses from this hollowed-out system."
sue.18.a: "Do they realize what they've done?"
sue.18.t: "Contraband Trade"
sue.18.d: "Suez's strategic position fuels smuggling of German-restricted goods like antibiotics. Complicit domestic firms and bribed officials render German law meaningless here."

sue.19.t: "Wage Issues"
sue.19.d: "Committee inaction on wage arrears sparks strikes. Balancing company demands against worker anger proves difficult."
sue.19.a: "Order immediate payment"
sue.19.b: "Workers must endure"

sue.20.t: "Working Hours"
sue.20.d: "Capitalists resist reducing 10-12 hour days to global 8-hour standards. Post-scandal reforms risk alienating companies or workers."
sue.20.a: "Approve worker demands"
sue.20.b: "How dare they demand?"

sue.21.t: "Emergency Legal Framework"
sue.21.d: "Rheinbaben's emergency laws targeting worker rights and judicial reforms face capitalist opposition. Choosing between principles and compromise looms."
sue.21.a: "No, never"
sue.21.b: "Necessary evil"

sue.22.t: "Full Investigation"
sue.22.d: "Anti-corruption efforts reveal Committee-company collusion. Only complete purge and restructuring can cleanse Suez."
sue.22.a: "Begin"

sue.23.t: "Anti-Corruption Strategy"
