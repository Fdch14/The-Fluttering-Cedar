 soccon_kemalism_subtype_desc:0 "§YKemalism§!\n\nThe term 'Kemalism' refers to the political ideology emerging from the ideas of Ottoman Grand Vizier Mustafa Kemal Pasha and his-led Ottoman People's Party. This quintessentially Turkish ideology sought to centralize and modernize the decaying Ottoman Empire. Kemalism advocated secularism modeled on European lines, arguing that modernization required excluding Islam from social and political life—a stance criticized by religious institutions and Sultan loyalists. On the other hand, it promoted Turkish nationalism and suppressed separatist movements threatening the empire's unity. While controversial, Kemalism was widely regarded as the primary solution to the 'Sick Man of Europe's' ailments."

It is the journey of root-seeking and redemption for brethren sharing the same roots, a desperate act to preserve justice and seek peace. Turanists believe that Altaic-speaking peoples such as Finns, Hungarians, Turks, Koreans, Mongolians, and Japanese share the same ancestors and bloodline. They advocate for the establishment of a vast Turanian Empire stretching from Finland to Japan, restoring the reintegration of the Turanian peoples to achieve the Great Unity.\n\nRed Turanism was proposed by Reha Oğuz Türkkan, a member of the Grey Wolves and an Ottoman politician. Red Turanism is a more radical ideology than Turanism. Red Turanists believe that Native Americans are actually Turanians who crossed the Bering Strait, demanding that the Americas be incorporated into the promised land of the Turanian peoples. Compared to other Turanists, Red Turanists pursue more vigorously the scientific establishment of Turanian racial superiority and advocate racial nationalism and genetic purity. Red Turanists also demand the militarization and centralization of society at all costs to achieve Turanian unification."

After the Great War ended, Ismail Enver Pasha, the former leader of the Young Turks, did not remain idle. He was heartbroken by the crumbling Ottoman Empire, yearning to reshape this beloved land according to his own vision. The Enver Cult aims to utterly reshape the Turkic lands by establishing a personal mystery cult centered around the Pasha. The Pasha's regime is imbued with strong Turkic nationalism, hoping to overthrow the Ottoman Empire to realize the Pasha's Turkic dream. He opposes unconditional Westernization and liberalism, but also dislikes Wahhabism and fundamentalism born from the Najd. The Enver regime critically accepts the progress and technology of Western nations and pins its hopes on the self-reform of Islam to transform the state and society. Enver possesses the unique charisma of a leader, exuding an irresistible aura of mystery. The well-known military myths of the Great War also united his people under the same banner, making them forget all divisions, leaving only unconditional loyalty and obedience to the Pasha. All this has created a unique esoteric cult on this land."

 ustase_subtype_desc:0 "§YUstaše§!\n\nThe Ustaše is not essentially a systematized ideological system, but specifically refers to the unique tradition of struggle formed within the Croatian revolutionary movement in the early twentieth century. Its core ideology is built upon radical Croatian nationalism and extreme xenophobia, fundamentally different from the revolutionary Ustaše organizations with leftist leanings. The action program of this far-right terrorist organization is full of violence, advocating for the complete liberation of the Croatian nation from the "yoke of alien peoples" through extreme measures such as assassinating colonial officials, carrying out bombings, and systematically cleansing ethnic minority enclaves.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Illyrian Federation, the organization rapidly declined, with over seventy percent of its core members choosing to join the new governmental system. Remnant forces went underground under the continuous crackdowns by the Federal Security Forces. However, in recent years, the Austrian Empire's implementation of centralizing reforms, gradually reducing Croatian autonomy and strengthening the official status of the German language, has led to a sharp intensification of ethnic conflicts. Against this backdrop, the long-dormant Ustaše organization has reemerged under the name "Free Crusade". They have reorganized into a cellular underground network, secretly recruiting young radicals at the University of Zagreb and Dalmatian shipyards, and acquiring weapons and equipment through nationalist forces abroad.\n\nThe new generation of Ustaše members continues the iron-blooded tradition, but their tactical methods exhibit modern characteristics: besides traditional axe assassinations, they now employ timed bomb attacks on railway hubs, spread extremist nationalist tutorials via the dark web, and plan biological weapon attacks against Austrian garrisons. Their manifesto explicitly declares the launch of a "holy war of ethnic cleansing", aiming not only to end Vienna's rule but also to completely purge all non-Croatian elements from the territory, establishing a "pure-blooded nation" from the Adriatic Sea to the Danube. Although condemned by mainstream political forces, this extreme agenda continues to spread in economically depressed rural areas and among industrial workers."

They attribute centuries of humiliation endured by the Croatian nation under foreign rule to internal national betrayal, Germanic cultural erosion, and Hungarian political oppression. Under the core program of achieving independence by any means necessary, the Resistance Crusade gradually developed three characteristics: adherence to extreme resistance strategies, creating panic through the forced conscription of youth, indiscriminate violence in multi-ethnic mixed areas, and suicide bombings; constructing a mobilization narrative based on historical trauma, defining Austrian rule as the beginning of systematic oppression of Croats, and using this to incite Croats to join the resistance; utilizing Catholic tradition and nationalist sentiment to forge spiritual bonds, firmly uniting organization members and Croats under a single banner.\n\nAs the military commander, Juraj Rukavina's command style combines guerrilla flexibility with terror tactics. The scorched-earth strategy he spearheads not only destroys transportation facilities in strategic locations but also systematically undermines the economic foundations essential for the coexistence of multi-ethnic communities. Despite his atrocious actions, in the eyes of some Croats, he is the only warrior daring to resist, for whom they are willing to sacrifice their lives."

 croatian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§YCroatian Socialism§!\n\nThe failure of the Russian Revolution in the early twentieth century had a profound impact on the international communist movement. Among communist intellectuals in the Croatian lands under Austro-Hungarian rule, severe ideological wavering occurred. With the victory of the Central Powers in the Great War, the Vienna authorities established the Illyrian Federation to alleviate ethnic tensions. This nominally autonomous Croatian entity did not change its vassal status, as German bureaucratic suppression and Germanization policies continued to erode local society. Against this backdrop, some former communists began to theoretically reconstruct the cause of national liberation alongside socialist ideals.\n\nThe fruit of this ideological fusion ultimately formed the doctrine of "Croatian Socialism". Its theoretical framework draws on the core propositions of four thinkers: the philosophy of the "Organic National Community" proposed by Stjepan Zimmermann, emphasizing the special historical mission of the Croatian nation; the "Ethics of Harmonious Labor" distilled by Čedomir Veljačić from Indian Vedic scriptures; the "Tribal Cooperative Tradition" proposed by Mirko Kus-Nikolajev based on ethnographic research; and the "Trade Union Federal Autonomy" model created by Aleksandar Seitz. This doctrine discards Marxism's class struggle paradigm, advocating instead for the construction of a "Croatian Community of Destiny" through cross-class national reconciliation.\n\nIn practice, its proponents sought to establish a grassroots autonomy network based on the traditional "zadruga" family communes, vertically integrating rural cooperatives with urban trade unions. They emphasized the symbiotic relationship between craft guilds and peasant associations, attempting to replace state bureaucratic institutions with joint industry councils."

 ustase_legionarism_subtype_desc:0 "§YUstaše Legionarism§!\n\nWhen the Romanian Iron Guard cleansed "enemies of the nation" with religious fervor and violence in the 1930s, its model of Legionarism quickly became a template for Europe's extreme right. This ideology, with its platform of anti-Semitism, anti-communism, and anti-democracy, built exclusive political groups through militarized organization and religious-style asceticism. Its influence extended beyond Romania, with France's Joseph Darnand, Italy's Nationalist Association, and Finland's Lapua Movement absorbing its core elements, forming a transnational extremist network.\n\nUnder the leadership of Jure Francetić, Croatia's Ustaše movement deeply integrated the Iron Guard model with local nationalism. Unlike traditional nationalists' demands for cultural autonomy, Ustaše Legionarism emphasizes achieving ethnic purification through violence. Members must undergo monastic-style discipline training: daily armed drills, reciting nationalist prayers, abstaining from tobacco, alcohol, and worldly pleasures. This military asceticism not only builds combat capability but also reinforces the collective consciousness of "martyrdom for God and nation" through ritualized living.\n\nIn his 1932 speech to overseas Croats, Francetić explicitly proposed transplanting the Iron Guard's "Death Squads" model to the Balkan theater. He particularly admired the Romanians' tactic of using daggers to execute "traitors" for its deterrent effect, and developed an even more systematic theory of violence on this basis—advocating public executions to create terror, forcing Serbs, Jews, and leftists to "voluntarily leave the stage of history"."

This ideology, born out of Futurist aesthetics, fused national revival with avant-garde art, creating a unique political spectrum—it contained both a religious-like worship of classical Roman glory and an ambiguous attitude towards industrial civilization and the contradictions of modernity.\n\nIt was precisely within this tension that Croatia's Ustaše movement found its ideological breakthrough. This Balkan nationalist group, originating from the nineteenth-century "Illyrian Movement", systematically absorbed its organizational structure and philosophy of action. Unlike traditional Croatian nationalists who emphasized cultural autonomy, Ustaše Fiumeists creatively grafted the corporatist economic model onto the framework of national revolution: they advocated both the elimination of class antagonism through guild alliances and the violent cleansing of "alien" non-native elements.\n\nAs a second-generation Ustaše theorist, Mladen Lorković systematically elaborated this ideology in his literary works. He believed that only Fiumeism touched the Croatian soul alienated by the Habsburg bureaucratic machine, and the mission of the Ustaše was to develop it into an operational project of national rebirth."
